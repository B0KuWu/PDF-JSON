This book covers multiple aspects of the Shadowrun\ngame and universe, providing new information for both gamemasters\nand players. The Shadowrun Companion expands on the basics of the\nShadowrun rules, offering more flexibility in character creation, cam-\npaign design, magic, and uses of Karma and nuyen, as well as provid-\ning new optional rules and creative ideas and solutions to common\nproblems that plague game play. The Shadowrun Companion is a\nrules expansion for Shadowrun, Second Edition (SRII).\n\ng SHADOWRUN Comeanion"

        "text": "The Shadowrun Companion takes players through the life of\na shadowrunner, from character creation to character retirement.\nThe Character Creation section expands and clarifies the charac-\nter creation system presented in SRI and adds variations on that\nsystem, including a point-based approach to character generation.\nThis section also introduces Edges and Flaws, a strategy that offers\na wide variety of personality traits to help players make each char-\nacter unique and that also can affect game play. In addition,\nCharacter Creation provides rules for playing a shapeshifter play-\ner character and introduces new metahuman variants.\n\nBecause the Shadowrun game system bases the outcome of\nmost actions on the successful use of skills, the Skills and Training\nsection offers a revised Skill Web designed with a more consistent\ninternal logic, and explains what aspects of the web were\nchanged and why. This section also clarifies and expands the skill\ndefaulting rules. Rules for training provide a system for learning\nnew skills and improving old ones in a more realistic way.\n\nPlayer-character contacts have always been an important but\nunder-used part of the Shadowrun universe. Contacts and\nEnemies suggests ways to expand the role of these non-player\ncharacters, from creating NPC personalities to exploring the dis-\ntinction between what a contact knows and what he’s willing to\nreveal, to staying on a contact’s good side and maintaining confi-\ndentiality. Players also can network their contacts through Friends\nof Friends, an option that adds new depth to characters’ sources\nfor information. This section also describes several non-traditional\ncontacts, including the Shadowland BBS. Contacts and Enemies\nprovides rules for creating enemies, non-player characters with a\nmore sinister reason for interacting with player characters, and\ntips for how to effectively present such NPCs in the game.\n\nThe Advanced Rules section offers new uses and optional\nrules for Karma, the first change to those rules since the release of\nShadowrun, Second Edition. These variations include the life-\nsaving Hand of God rule, favors and markers, and guidelines for\ncharacter advancement in an amoral (Karma-less) campaign. This\nsection also offers advanced rules for tailoring the way magic\nfunctions; a system for creating workable statistics for famous\nNPCs, threats and other opponents of shadowrunners; state-of-\nthe-art rules, which allow gamemasters to control the technology\ncurve in their campaigns; and a few often-requested options for\nfamiliar rules.\n\nRunning the Game offers gamemasters a framework and out-\nline to use in designing their own scenarios, adventures and cam-\npaigns. Alternate Campaign Concepts shows gamemasters how\nto develop and run alternative campaign archetypes and Includes\nexamples of player character groups such as Doc Wagon EMTs\nand Lone Star teams. This section also provides rules for creating\nstreet gangs and designing gang-member characters, suggests\ncampaign hooks for drawing street gangs into a Shadowrun\ngame, and describes five Seattle gangs in detall to demonstrate\nthe possibilities of running gang story lines.\n\nFILLING IN THE BLANKS\n\nTo those of you who have been playing the game since its\ninception, for FASA to produce a rules companion six years after\nthe initial rules were published might seem like a step backward.\nIt's entirely likely that the bulk of the material in this book covers\naspects of the game that you currently ignore or for which you\nlong ago made up house rules, or that all your questions have\nbeen answered at a Shadowrun seminar at a convention. You may\nfeel a bit disappointed that this book is not filled with new rules:\nyou might even have been hoping for Shadowrun, Third Edition.\nWe sympathize with your feelings. Quite frankly, the difficulty of\nproducing a successful companion book to the basic rules of a\ngame is that a companion book should respond to player ques-\ntions and comments in a useful, effective way—and it's hard to\ndecide when to stop compiling information and actually publish a\nresponse.\n\nIn the years since the publication of the second edition of\nShadowrun, we have noticed an increase in general questions\nabout the basics of playing, running and having fun with the\nShadowrun game, from both new and veteran players. Instead of\nasking about the complexity of using the metaplanes, advanced\nMatrix design or the mysteries of cybermancy, Shadowrun play-\ners wanted more information about character creation, Karma,\nhow to sustain a campaign, the uses of skills and contacts—the\nbasic concepts of the game.\n\nWith any game system and universe, especially one as rich as\nShadowrun, the tendency is to make each book more significant,\nbigger, filled with more toys—to up the ante, push the envelope,\nkeep the fans entertained and always give them something new\nand exciting. Each product needs to outshine the previous offer-\ning. While that kind of one-upmanship keeps us on our toes and\nconstantly improves the product we produce, It also means that\nwe sometimes forget to answer the players’ basic questions. The\nnumber of players and gamemasters asking for advice about\nexactly what they are supposed to do with this diverse, intriguing\nuniverse prompted us to reevaluate our plan for The Shadowrun\nCompanion. We feel confident that the result will satisfy the play-\ners asking those questions.\n\nEven if you have already found a way to fill in the blanks left\nby published Shadowrun products, we believe you will find\nnew, interesting and fun concepts in this book. As always,\ngamemasters should modify, adapt or rework these rules as nec-\nessary to accommodate their groups’ style of play. Because all\nthe rules in The Shadowrun Companion are considered to be\noptional, gamemasters and players should agree on which rules\nthey will use before incorporating any of these concepts into\ntheir games. The goal of The Shadowrun Companion is to make\nplaying Shadowrun even more enjoyable; do whatever it takes\nto make your game fun!\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

Agonizing over Attribute choices, try-\ning to squeeze maximum efficiency out of every Skill Point and\ndeliberating for hours over the purchase of each piece of equip-\nment, players put a lot of effort into designing lean, mean fight-\ning (or decking, or spellcasting or driving) machines. Finally, they\npush the mountain of sourcebooks and scrap paper aside and\nproudly present a completed character sheet to the gamemaster,\nwho looks it over and asks, “So, what's this guy like?”\n\n“Uh, well,” the player says, “he's a street samurai, you know? Um\n... kind of tough, fearless, honorable ... you know, a street samurai.”\n\nOr, “She's a typical decker, kind of geeky, really cocky about\nher decking skills and nervous about everything else.”\n\nOr, “My cat shaman? He's, uh ... (sound of pages flipping) ...\n‘stealthy, vain, cunning and sometimes cruel.’ Yeah, that's it.”\n\nWhy are so many players willing to spend so much time on\ntheir characters’ guns, gear and statistics, but so little on their per-\nsonalities? Combat may be exciting, but players could certainly\nexperience the same vicarious thrill of blowing things up by visit-\ning the local video arcade. Roleplaying games offer much more\nthan the thrill of combat. They allow players to take on roles, to\nbecome actors in stories of their own creation. That's why the\nbasic concept of a character is important. Background, motivation,\npersonality—these things make characters interesting. And the\nmore interesting and distinctive you make your role, the more\nyou—and everyone else in your game group—will enjoy play.\n\nA character's place in a team of shadowrunners is determined\nby his personality at least as much as his abilities. Characters who\nbear striking similarities in game terms may be wildly different in\noutlook and effectiveness, depending on their personalities and\nthe way their players portray them. Consider one of the most basic\ncharacter types, the “guy with lots of combat-oriented cyber-\nware.” The Shadowrun core rules alone offer four variants on this\nbasic theme: the street samurai, bodyguard, former company man\nand mercenary. All these characters possess several of the same\nimportant elements: wired reflexes, smartlinks, excellent physical\nstats and at least one Big Gun. In fact, you could substitute the\nstreet samurai statistics for any of the other characters’ statistics,\nand the change would make very little difference. So what distin-\nguishes these characters from each other? Each follows a different\nmindset, takes a different approach to the world.\n\nThe street samurai is an urban preciator who balances honor,\nloyalty and reputation against the need to survive on the mean\nstreets. The bodyguard is trained to take a bullet for her client. Her\nprimary goals may change as she runs the shadows, but she’s still\nwilling to put her life on the line to achieve her objective. Unlike\nthe samurai, however, she won't die for honor. The former com-\npany man may have left his company behind, but he’s still as hard\nas he has to be to get the job done and survive. If that means tak-\ning someone out, he'll do it in a heartbeat. Maybe he'll regret it\nlater, but that’s the biz, sweetheart. The mercenary has two goals:\nearn her nuyen and stay alive to spend it. Sure, she'll take risks,\nbut only when necessary. Every step of the way, she has her eyes\nfixed firmly on the bottom line. She may agree with your cause or\nyour politics, but she never works for free.\n\nIt is these personality differences—not the archetype name at\nthe top of the page, not the game statistics—that distinguish\nthese four similar character types. The preceding examples offer\nonly the broadest, most stereotypical characterizations, but even\nthese bare-bones personality outlines provide better character-\nbuilding frameworks than statistics alone.\n\nSo when you create your next new character, try spending\nsome extra time on the twenty questions posed on pages 47-48\nof Shadowrun, Second Edition (SRI). You may want to add more\ndetail to your character's background as he or she develops a\nstronger, more distinct personality during gaming sessions, but\nthese guidelines offer enough of a framework to give you, your\ngroup and your gamemaster a few strong “hooks” to make your\ncharacter come alive. Regardless of which questions you choose\nto answer for your character, ask yourself why the character made\neach decision. Why did your former wage mage leave her cushy\nresearch job to run the shadows, where she gets to sleep in cof-\nfin motels and dodge bullets? Why did your decker sink his entire\nlife's savings into a single, three-pound hunk of electronics? Why\ndid your street shaman choose the path of Gator? (Here's a hint:\nthe correct answer is not. “To get +2 dice for Combat and\nDetection spells.”)\n\nSTART WITH THE STORY\n\nPlayers can take the concept of story-based character creation\none step further by designing the character's background before\ndetermining his or her statistics. Rather than beginning the charac-\nter-creation process by saying, “! want to play a rigger,” and then\ndesigning a background that fits the abilities you want him or her to\nhave, create the character's background first and select his or her\ngame abilities based on the character's life story. The following\nexample shows how two runners based on the same premise can\ndevelop into very different characters through their backgrounds.\n\nImagine that you want your character to be a female human\nrigger who developed an interest in vehicles at an early age. The\nlogical place to start is by determining how a young kid might get\ninvolved with vehicles in the first place. Suppose that Character A\nis the daughter of a high-ranking corporate military officer, and\nwas fascinated by the t-birds and helicopters she saw every time\nshe visited her father’s base. At home, she spent most of her free\ntime playing flight-sim games and watching military vids. When\nshe took her corporate aptitude tests, she rated in the top per-\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPAnIoOn"

For her own protection she joined her brother's go-\ngang, where she had to learn to ride—and fight—to stay alive.\nThe go-gang did the occasional minor job for a local yakuza clan,\nand Character B's raw talent and hunger for success soon caught\nthe attention of the oyabun. He recruited her to run low-priority\nerrands for the clan, anc her solid performance eventually led him\nto rely on her for jobs requiring greater levels of responsibility and\ntrust. After a year or two, the yakuza recruited Character B as a\nlow-level soldier.\n\nOnce you establish the foundation for the background, con-\nsider some of the early changes the character may have under-\ngone. For example, every would-be rigger eventually needs to\nacquire some cyberware, if only a vehicle control rig. Turning\npoints such as these offer good opportunities to explore your\ncharacter's thoughts and motivations. How does your character\nfeel about having a computer implanted into her brain? Character\nA would probably feel few quaims about such a step; working in\na high-tech environment, surrounded by experts with easy access\nto all the top-notch cyberware they need to do their jobs, she\nwould probably be eager to go under the laser and jump-start her\ncareer. Character B, on the other hand, might well dread having\nthe rig implanted. But if the yakuza—at this point, her only route\nout of the gutter—made it clear that her continued employment\ndepended on her accepting cyberware, she might feel compelled\nto undergo the surgery despite her fears. As a result, she might\nnever really embrace her tech and perhaps even refuse to consid-\ner further implants.\n\nAfter creating your character's early life story, decide how\nyour character became a shaciowrunner. Character A, for example,\nwould need a pretty dramatic reason to turn against the corporate\nworld of her youth. Perhaps her father refused to follow an order\nthat he morally opposed, and corporate officials court-martialed\nhim and ousted him from the ranks in disgrace, Or perhaps anoth-\nercorp tried to “recruit” him, and his parent corporation killed him\nrather than let him defect. Either event would shock and disillu-\nsion Character A, and she might well turn to the streets out of bit-\nterness and a desire for revenge.\n\nCharacter B, on the other hand, grew up close to the shad-\nows as part of the go-gang, and her stint as a yakuza courier kept\nher on the street. Perhaps running against the corps was a natur-\nal reaction when a corporate strike team wiped out her brother's\ngang in response to some petty vandalism or as a distraction for\nsome covert operation. Her decision to run the shadows might\njust as easily be a result of heavy recruitment by shadowrunner\nfriends or a misguided belief that living the “glamorous” life of a\nshadowrunner represents a move up in the world. Character B's\npresence in the shadows takes on a completely different dimen-\nsion if the yakuza did not approve of her choice.\n\nNow that you've figured out how your character ended up in\nthe shadows, you can go to the rulebook and build her statistics.\nThe most logical allocation for Character A would be Priority A for\nResources, Priority B to Skills and Priority C for Attributes. She\n\nwould probably be carrying a substantial amount of military cyber-\nware, most likely including a headware radio, crypto circuit and\nsimilar communications gear. Her skills would focus on military-\nstyle helicopters, planes, drones and t-birds and include Tactics\nand perhaps Leadership, but only minimal self-defense skills,\nbecause she wasn’t trained to operate outside her vehicle. Her pri-\nmary contacts would be corporate and military.\n\nPriorities for Character B, the ex-go-ganger, might sensibly be\ndistributed as Attributes A, Resources B and Skills C. The only cyber-\nware she might have is the vehicle control rig, with perhaps a spur,\nsmartlink or other personal defense cyberware to help protect her\non the streets. Her Vehicle Skills would center on cars and motorcy-\ncles, based on minimal exposure to larger and more expensive\nvehicles. She would, however, possess better personal defense skills\nthan Character A, because she grew up depending on herself rather\nthan her squadmates for protection. Her contacts would include\ngang, yakuza, and other street-level people and organizations.\n\nAfter selecting your character's game statistics, you can\ndefine her personality, based on her life history. This may not\nseem important, but your character's personality will determine\nhow she acts and reacts to different situations. For example,\nCharacter A's military background would probably give her a dis-\nciplined, by-the-book mentality—she might even be a bit too\nstrait-laced and rigid at times. As a runner, she would want clear-\nly defined objectives, and would probably be reluctant to change\nobjectives in mid-run. She would likely have little tolerance for\nlooting, inter-team bickering and other unprofessional behavior—\nshe would expect the other team members to show the same pro-\nfessional discipline that she does. She would also be reacly to\neither give or follow orders.\n\nCharacter B's unsupervised childhood on the streets would\nlikely leave her independent, strong-willed and stubborn. Though\nless disciplined than Character A, Character B would be more flex-\nible, able to adapt to changing situations on the fly. She would be\nfar less likely than Character A to wait patiently in the van piloting\ndrones while the run takes place.\n\nTHE SKY’S THE LIMIT\n\nThe background-first approach to character creation illus-\ntrates one of the basic strengths of the Shadowrun character sys-\ntem—it is not limited by character classes. While other roleplay-\ning games provide distinct sets of character classes that can be\ncombined only in a limited number of ways, the players’ own\nimaginations are the only limits in the Shadowrun character cre-\nation system. In the preceding example, Character A combines\naspects of the rigger, former company man and former military\nofficer archetypes, while Character B adds parts of the ganger\narchetype to her rigger nature. Because Shadowrun characters\nare not limited by class, they can have any sort of skill or ability\nthat players want and gamemasters allow. In fact, the best\nShadowrun characters, like the most interesting people, combine\nmany different “roles” to create a well-rounded whole.\n\nThe archetypes in the Shadowrun, Second Edition (SRI!)\nrulebook and supplements represent some of the major types of\ncharacters in the game world. They are examples, nothing more.\nThey allow inexperienced players to jump into the game and start\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion"

So don’t hesitate to go beyond the archetypes and famil-\niar stereotypes when creating Shadowrun characters—variety Is\nthe spice of life, and a unique, rich character will make the game\nmore fun for everyone.\n\nConsider, for example, the possibilities of a detective charac-\nter who also happens to be a mage, like the character in\nAwakenings. Think about the potential of a secret-seeking Snake\nshaman who's also a newsfax reporter, a Shark adept hit man, or\nmaybe a decker who enjoys his Three Musketeers reality filter so\nmuch that he actually becomes a competent swordsman. Let your\nimagination run wild. An imaginative background story opens up\na multitude of possible combinations—and it’s more fun than sim-\nply designing a character around a particular set of abilities.\n\nThe background-first method of character design can also\nsuggest dozens of adventure hooks you can use to involve your\ncharacters in games. Say your group includes a mage who has a\nkid sister, for example. The seemingly ordinary corporate extrac-\ntion that your group just got involved in may seem a lot more\ninteresting if the targeted biotechnical engineer also happens to\nbe working on a cure for the mysterious disease that’s killing the\nmage’s kid sister. Or maybe your playing group contains a street\nshaman who has claimed an area of the Barrens as his own littie\nurban protectorate. When a megacorp buys the area and the\nwreckers move in to make way for new condos, will the shaman\nfight to defend his turf or try to move “his people” out? Will the\nother characters on his team help him?\n\nThese types of aciventures can provide a refreshing change of\npace from the usual fixer-generated jobs and give player charac-\nters a chance to affect their game world more directly. By creat-\ning rich backgrounds for their characters, players don’t have to\nrely on their gamemasters alone to come up with interesting runs.\nThe personalities and motives of the characters themselves and\nthe events of their lives can spawn adventures and help foster\nmore varied, less predictable play.\n\n—\" ~~\nPe =~.\n\nTeERC REATI on\nvane j\n\nSOMETHING TO CONSIDER\n\nGamemasters determine\nevery character's relationship to\nthe rest of the Shadowrun\nworld once a game begins, so\nplayers and their gamemasters\nshould work together when\nplayers create new characters.\nCooperation helps prevent play-\ners from surprising gamemas-\nters with character elements\nthey may not want in their\ngames, and lessens the chances\nthat a gamemaster will disallow\na character that one of his play-\ners has created.\n\nResources\n(Nuyen/\nForce Points)\n1,000,000/50\n\nPoints\n40\n30 400,000/35\n\n24 90,000/25\n\n20 5,000/15\n17 500/5\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nAfter determining the personality and background of a char-\nacter, the player must translate the character's traits into game sta-\ntistics. The first step is to assign one each of five priorities to five\ndifferent categories that describe the character. This section illus-\ntrates the finer points of assigning priorities.\n\nThe Master Character Creation Table also appears on p. 47, SRIL.\n\nThe Shadowrun character-creation system enables players to\nassign priorities to five areas; Race, Magic, Attributes, Skills and\nResources, Assigning a high priority to Magic and/or Race opens\nup a wide range of possibilities for roleplaying and offers both the\nplayer and the gamemaster a point of reference for story lines and\ncharacter motivations. Attributes, Skills and Resources have the\nmost impact on how well your character performs his job on a\nshadowrunning team.\n\nThe priority you assign to Attributes, Skills or Resources\naffects your character's ability to survive it all, do it well or have it\nall, The higher your base Attributes, the better your character's\nsurvivability. The more Skill Points he or she begins with, the bet-\nter your character is at what you want him or her to accomplish.\nThe higher the starting Resources, the more equipment and other\ngoodies your character can have to do his or her job.\n\nFor example, a character with Priority A in Attributes begins\nthe game with high enough Attribute values to have an excellent\nchance of surviving whatever the gamemaster throws at him—by\nvirtue of Quickness, Strength and Intelligence, among other qual-\nities—and substantial default values for skills he may lack. Giving\nthe character Priority B in Attributes only means the character is\nmore likely to have average Attribute values, which will still serve\nto keep him or her alive long enough to improve.\n\nIf you assign Priority A to Skills, you can give your character a\nwider range of options. For example, you can give your character\nmultiple skills at an average level, producing a well-rounded char-\nacter with an impressive variety of solid skills. This approach works\nwell when designing deckers or riggers, who need a greater num-\nber of skills to do their jobs effectively. If you assign Priority B to\nSkills, you can give your character fewer skills but at a higher rating,\neffectively creating a specialist such as a fighter or magic-user.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPepanion"

        "text": "When determining what priority to assign to Resources,\nplayers must balance their desire to give their characters every\nneat toy in the game against the realities of encumbrance: how\nmany guns and other weapons can one man or woman really use\nat once? Because deckers and riggers need a certain amount of\nexpensive equipment to function effectively in the game, players\ndesigning those types of characters may want to assign Priority A\nto Resources. For any other type of character, Priority B in\nResources offers enough starting cash to buy most necessary\nequipment, pay for a decent lifestyle and subscribe to a\nDocWagon health-insurance program.\n\nTara figures a SEAL decker would need to\nmake both Matrix and Physical Skills a high pri-\nority, and would need hefty resources to acquire\nserious cyberware and an expensive cyberceck.\nTara decides to give Skills Priority A (40 points),\nResources Priority B (400,000 nuyen), Attributes\nPriority C (20 points), Race Priority D (human)\nand Magic Priority E (magic and the Matrix gen-\nerally don't mix well). This is the same mix of pri-\norities as the former company man archetype (p.\n55, SRI), but Tara plans to give her decker a\ntotally different feel than that archetype.\n\nRACE AND MAGIC\n\nBeing a member of a metahuman race or a magic user has a\nbig impact on any character, and any metahuman or magic-using\ncharacter's background should reflect that impact. If you're playing\nsuch a character, think about how these conditions affect your char-\nacter’s life. Ask yourself, when did the character realize that he was\ndifferent from most other people? Was the character born in a pre-\ndominantly human town, or in Seattle's ork community? If the char-\nacter is a mage or shaman, how does he or she view magic? Is he\nexperiencing Drain because channeling energy has burned him out\nor because his totem thinks he shouldn't be casting powerballs so\noften? Are his Killing Hands reaily the hate of his ancestors focused\non his enemies? The answers to these types of questions help deter-\nmine how your character works In the game.\n\nATTRIBUTES\n\nA character's Attributes—Body, Quickness, Strength,\nCharisma, Intelligence and Willpower—represent the raw materi-\nal that makes up every person: his or her body, what the charac-\nter has done with that body, and what's inside the person that\nmakes him or her unique. Because Attributes can be improved\nduring the course of a character's life, they represent something\nmore than genetics.\n\nThe Body Attribute determines a character's resistance to\noutside forces. It represents the character's cardiovascular fitness\nand endurance, immune system, how well he heals, how well he\nadjusts to bioware, his tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and, to\nsome extent, his muscle and bone structure and weight. Low\nBody could mean a character is skinny and frail-boned, or has bad\neating and health habits. A character recovering from a nasty dis-\n\nease or extensive cyberware surgery might have low Body as\nwell. High Body means a character is better fed, tough as nails,\nhas strong bones with some spring to them and an immune sys-\ntem that won't quit.\n\nQuickness represents a character's motor reflexes, balance,\nmetabolism, running speed, flexibility and coordination. A charac-\nter with low Quickness might be a trid potato, have an inner ear dis-\nturbance, or might simply have a tendency to freeze up in emer-\ngency situations. High Quickness means that a character has devel-\noped fluidity and grace, perhaps through a regimen of running,\nmartial arts or even typing (which builds up manual dexterity).\n\nStrength denotes what a character's muscles can do.\nStrength Is somewhat dependent on a character's size and\nmetatype. If your character is a 5-foot-tall, 115-pound human girl,\nshe's unlikely to possess an unaugmented Strength Attribute of 6.\nOn the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that\nof reptiles (to reflect this, starting dwarf characters receive a +2\nStrength bonus). Characters with low Strength may be small, skin-\nny or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high-Strength char-\nacter may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her\nbest advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin’ BIG.\n\nCharisma is a nebulous Attribute. More than just looks,\nCharisma represents a character's self-image, ego, willingness to\nfind out what people want and give it to them, and ability to rec-\nognize what he can and can’t get out of people. A whiny\ndemeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to react body lan-\nguage or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character\nlow Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy\nentertaining others, may honestly want to help people and devel-\nop friendships, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is\ntoday. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right\nmoment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or command\nrespect because her timing Is always impeccable.\n\nIntelligence represents a character's perceptual and analyti-\ncal abilities, memorizing ability and raw brain power. It denotes\nhow fast a character learns, adapts or remembers. Low\nIntelligence does not mean stupidity; instead, it might denote a\ncharacter who discounts things too quickly rather than seeing how\nhe might use them, Such a character may not think beyond the\nmoment, may be easily distracted, or may simply rely on instinct\nrather than intellect. High Intelligence, on the other hand, means\na character can keep track of several things at once, integrate old\nmemories with whatever he's working on now, and apply gener-\nal principles to specific problems. Such characters learn fast—they\nmay not have gone to school for years and years, but if someone\ncompetent explains something to them, they'll get it.\n\nWillpower keeps a character going when he wants to give\nup, or enables him to control his habits and emotions. Willpower\ndetermines whether or not a character is going to take charge of\nhis life. A character with low Willpower might defer to other peo-\nple when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-\nWillpower character is more assured and possesses a never-say-\ndie streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because\nthat's exactly the fragging point.\n\n6\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

With only 20 Attribute Points, Virgil\nisn't quite the hoop-kickin’ dude Tara originally\nenvisioned. After distributing those points, Virgil\nhas Body 3. Quickness 4, Strength 3, Charisma 1,\nIntelligence 5 and Willpower 4. Tara justifies\nthese low numbers by deciding that Virgil is\nleaving the military to chase money—big-time.\nHe plans to sell some “borrowed” military pass-\ncodes to an organized crime group—but he\ndoesn't know any, yet.\n\nAs play begins, the other PCs are going to find\nVirgil a bitter decker who's spending most of his\nlife in the Matrix rather than the real world, let-\nting his fine-tuned body slip down to normal\nstandards and wasting his self-image and enthu-\nsiasm. But he’s no wash-out: he’s smart, and\nhe’s got enough guts to go on a life-risking shad-\nowrun. His Charisma is in the toilet, but only\nbecause he's uncommunicative with people he\ndoesn't know, such as the other runners. He is\nstill a team player, and with a little good fortune\nand some encouraging successes, he can turn\ninto a serious runner with some valuable skills,\ncontacts and hardware.\n\nSKILLS\n\nSkills represent the abilities your character has worked for and\nlearned. So how did your character get them? Why does he con-\ncentrate on or specialize in certain skills—or why doesn’t he? Car\n6 is great for a rigger, but it means your character can drive a big\nrig just as well as a passenger vehicle—where'd he learn to do\nthat? When you create a character, go through each of your char-\nacter's skills and think of a short explanation of why and how he\nor she learned it.\n\nFor a real-world example of what the skill rating scale means,\nlet's look at Unarmed Combat. No skill at all means the character\ndoesn't really know what he’s doing. He might think he does, but\nhe's just getting by on intuition. He's never really been in a fight\nor even thought about it much. If he hits someone, he could seri-\nously hurt his hand.\n\nA character with an Unarmed Combat Rating of | has proba-\nbly thought about unarmed fighting a little. Perhaps she's just\nstarted taking karate classes, and has learned to make a proper fist\nand throw a formal punch. The character's form isn't great—she\ndoesn't know where to strike an opponent and where not to, and\nshe certainly hasn't tried out any moves on a live, moving target.\n\nA character with Unarmed Combat 2 has started to put it\ntogether—blocking, moving forward and backward, gauging\nrange when hitting or getting beneath someone's center of grav-\nity when wrestling. He's figured out that if you attack high and\nthen low, you might beat someone's reaction time and hit them\nwhere they're not expecting it. At Unarmed Combat 3, the char-\nacter has a good chance of hurting someone pretty badly. She's\nstarting to read her opponent's body movements, recognizing\n\nTER CREA Tion\n\npatterns in fighting, and experimenting with new techniques.\nHowever, her fighting style boils down to a few key moves.\n\nA character with Unarmed Combat 4 has been training for\nthree or four years and has developed enough ability to knock an\nopponent down and Moderately wound him. The character is\nlearning to fight well by most methods (weapons, feet, hands,\nelbows, wrestling), though he has a favorite method on which he\nrelies heavily.\n\nAt Unarmed Combat 5 or 6, a character can usually survive\nmost battles. Such characters know a few tricks, can pull off some\nadvanced combat moves (fingertip strikes to the throat, chokes,\n\n~ quick arm breaks and so on) and are generally people you don’t\n\nwant to pick on. Such characters may be first- or second-degree\nblack belts, serious street-fighters, bodyguards or bouncers.\n\nA character with Unarmed Combat 7 or 8 is serious bad\nnews. She's the sort of individual that the cops hire to instruct\ntheir patrolmen in the Barrens. She can take a weapon away from\nan experienced opponent or strike an opponent's vulnerable pres-\nsure points and shut down his nervous system. Achieving an\nUnarmed Combat rating of 9 or higher usually requires fifteen to\ntwenty years of study, experimentation or intense specialization in\na single area of combat. Such characters might retire undefeated\nfrom a fighting circuit, found their own martial arts style. beat up\nphysads just for fun and teach the Sioux Wildcats and Tir Ghosts a\nthing or two.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that no game supplement can possibly\nlist all the different types of expertise characters can conceivably\nacquire. Think about what your character would know if he or she\nwere a real person. Nearly everybody has acquired at least three\nspecialized abilities or areas of expertise they may not think of as\npotential game skills. You can use hobbies, passions and bits of\ninformation learned through the years to flesh out your character.\n\nTara assigns Virgil skills and skill ratings based\non the background she's created for him. Like all\nSEAL deckers, Virgil possesses considerable\ndecking and deck-construction expertise, so she\ngives him Computer 6 and Computer (B/R) 6.\nShe decides that he doesn't concentrate or spe-\ncialize in either Computer Skill, because he must\nbuild his own deck, write his own programs and\nserve as the resident computer expert for the\nrest of his shadowrunning team. After consider-\ning his general knowledge in this area, Tara\ngives Virgil Electronics 5 as well.\n\nVirgil also has formal education in computer\nscience, so Tara gives him Computer Theory 3.\nThat leaves Tara with 20 remaining points for\nVirgil's other skills. The decker's career with the\nSEALs has provided him with experience in night\nmaneuvers, demolitions, exercising and a little\ncombat, so Tara gives Virgil Stealth 4,\nDemolitions 4, Athletics 4, Unarmed Combat 4\nand Firearms 4.

Tara purchases for Virgil the Language\nSkill of Japanese at a Skill Rating of 2.\nConsequently. he'll sound like a foreigner when\nhe speaks the language, but he'll know enough to\nget by.\n\nTara doesn't have enough Skill Points left to\ngive Virgil the Car Skill, so she simply notes his\ndriving ability on the back of his character sheet.\nWithout a Driving Skill, however, Virgil must rely\non the autopilot when driving. Virgil also attend-\ned the Virginia Military Institute and majored in\ncomputer science, so he knows some other handy\nsubjects, such as higher math, that his skills won't\nreflect. These subjects include Morse code,\nwilderness survival tricks, SCUBA diving tech-\nniques, and the ability to translate lots of military\nacronyms. Virgil's also a snorkler and knows about\nas much marine biology as Tara does.\n\nTara’s Resources priority for Virgil gives her\n400.000 nuyen to spend, which she uses to pur-\nchase Wired Reflexes 1, Enhanced Articulation\nand a smartgun link. The Wired Reflexes enable\nVirgil to move with a superhuman 2D6 + 7\nInitiative, and the Enhanced Articulation\nbioware adds 1D6 to his Physical Skills. so he\nlooks coordinated and smooth, The smartgun\nlink, of course, makes him a pretty good shot.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nThe Resources Attribute provides two things: money to pur-\nchase cyberware, gear and extras; and Force Points for magic\nspells and foci. Only magicians receive Force Points, but all char-\nacters receive the money.\n\nAs with Attributes and skills, let your character's background\nsuggest appropriate gear when allocating resources. Characters\nshould not be able to pull money and gear out of thin air—they\nshould only possess items they can plausibly pay for and obtain.\nbased on their backgrounds,\n\nWhen assigning a priority to your character's Resources, keep in\nmind the optional rules for availability (p. 90), reputation (p. 32, and\nShadowbeat for media-based characters), and otaku (Virtual\nRealities 2.0). These rules can affect the way your character is played,\nso you may want to review them before assigning Resources.\n\nVirgil has extensive military special-ops and\ncomputer training, so the gamemaster allows\nTara to select gear from Fields of Fire and Virtual\nRealities 2.0 as well as from SRI.\n\nTara selects the items listed below:\n\nItem Cost (¥)\nLevel 3 datajack 2,000\nCybereyes 5,000\nLow Light 3,000\nFlare Compensation 2,000\nOptical Mag-3 6,000\nSmartlink Il 3,200\nWired reflexes | 55,000\nEnhanced articulation 40,000\nRetractable cyberspurs 11,500\n800-Mp computer 16.000\nMicrotronics shop 15.000\nMicrotronics kit 1,500\nProgramming shop 15,000\nHitachi RM-AX optical chip encoder 9,500\nH&K MP-STX 850\nw/Smartiink I 800\nShock pad 200\nSound suppressor 750\n5 clips, 100 rounds regularammo = 225\nColt Manhunter 425\nw/Smartiink I 800\n5 clips, 80 rounds explosive ammo 300\nSurvival knife 45\nClimbing kit 250\nform-fitting body armor (Level |) 150\nCamouflage armor jacket 1,200\n5 extra contacts 25,000\n\n1 year of Middle lifestyle at 2 residences 120,000\nTracking signal for deck\n\n(Concealability 4) 400\nSignal locator for deck (Rating 4) 4,000\n(2) Rating 5 maglocks 1,000\n2 counterfeit SINs NA\nHonda-GM 3220 ZX 30.000\nDocWagon Gold Service 25,000\nUzi Il 600\n\nw/Smartlink 800\n\nSilencer 500\n10 flash grenades 400\n10 smoke grenades 300\nMetal restraints 50\nArmored tuxedo 1,100\n\nTotal cost « 399,845\nNuyen remaining = 155\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

That decision explains\nthe 800-Mp computer, microtronics shop and\nkit, programming shop, and the Hitachi RM-AX\noptical chip encoder,\n\nVirgil's five extra contacts include an old deck-\ner friend who now works for Lone Star, a fixer, a\ndeckmeister, a rigger and his former command-\ning officer. For Virgil's two free contacts, Tara\nselects a yakuza soldier and a yakuza boss—she\nreasons that the yakuza boss originally lured\nVirgil away from the SEALs.\n\nInitially, Tara wanted to give Virgil a Panther\nassault cannon. The gamemaster nixed that iclea,\nhowever. Even considering Virgil's military back-\nground, it seemed unlikely that a decker would\nbe able to obtain such a powerful weapon. The\ngamemaster therefore invoked the optional\nAvailability rule (p. 90), which applies because\nthe Panther's Availability is higher than 6. In\nplace of the Panther, Tara selected a silenced,\nsmart submachine gun and some other nifty\nitems, such as flash and smoke grenades for\nhouse-to-house runs, metal restraints in case\nVirgil needs to kidnap someone, sunglasses and\nan armored tuxedo.\n\nTara completes her character by dividing his\nremaining nuyen of 155 by 10 for a total of 15.\nRolling 3 dice to calculate Virgil's starting nuyen\nyields a 3, 3 and 6, which equals 12,000 nuyen\n(12 x 1,000¥). Tara adds the 15 nuyen left over\nfrom character creation for a final starting nuyen\ntotal of 12,015. Virgil now has 12 credsticks\nworth 1,000 nuyen each and one worth 15\nnuyen, It's time for Virgil to hit the shadows!\n\nFINISHING TOUCHES\n\nAfter completing the game statistics, you can put the finish-\ning touches on your character by creating a biographical sketch.\nThen the gamemaster can introduce the character into game play.\n\nA biographical sketch combines all the bits of background\nyou've created for your character. Tell the gamemaster as much as\nyou can about the character. This is your chance to go crazy. It's\nyour character, so he or she can have whatever history you want—\nno rules, priorities or numbers to worry about. Once again, the\nTwenty Questions on pages 47-48, SRII offer a good place to\nStart with this part of the creative process.\n\nAs soon as you are finished fleshing out your character, the\ngamemaster can find a way to introduce the new runner into\ngame play. A story line that lets the character demonstrate his\nstrengths and weaknesses makes for an interesting, believable\nintroduction, especially if the story also provides opportunities for\n\nThough Virgil left the SEALs for the potentially\nlucrative career of a shadowrunner, Tara is not\nsatisfied with the simple motivation that “he's\nmoney-grubbing slime.” She decides that Virgil\ngrew up in the newly seceded CAS. His family\nexperienced all sorts of financial problems, so\nwhen Virgil was offered a scholarship, he accept-\ned immediately. Virgil worked hard to get on to\na SEAL team, and military life satisfied him for\nseveral years. As time wore on, however, he\ngrew disenchanted with it. When a serious ill-\nness sent his father to the hospital, Virgil decic-\ned the time had come to leave the SEALs and\nmake some quick money. Shadowrunning\nseemed the best way to do that.\n\nWhen a yakuza operative contacted Virgil and\noffered him a generous payment for military pass-\ncodes, Virgil realized opportunity had come his\nway. That deal alone enabled Virgil to pay for his\nfather’s medical bills, but Virgil realized he could\nnever go back to the SEALs. He resigned his Navy\ncommission a few weeks later and began offering\nhis services in the shadow market.\n\nVirgil likes to work on a close-knit team where\neveryone covers each other. He's content to fol-\nlow orders given by other people (this works out\nwell because Tara is an _ inexperienced\nShadowrun player). Virgil doesn’t have many\nfriends outside of his team and contacts, and he\ncares little about higher causes. Virgil likes puns,\nmarine biology, action simsense and figuring out\nhow to assemble machines.\n\nVirgil is about 1.68 meters tall and 73 kilos, with\nbrown hair and light brown eyes. His teeth aren't\nquite straight because his dad couldn't afford\nbraces for him during his childhood. He carries a\nscar on his left torso as a result of being bitten by a\ndog as a child.\n\nTara explains Virgil's background to the other\nplayers, who are running an ork gang member\n(Teeth) and an elf razorpunk (Zero-One), Both of\nthese characters want to stick it to Humanis.\nRealistically, Virgil probably wouldn't work with\nthese guys for very long, but the gamemaster sug-\ngests that Virgil's fixer—the same fixer contact that\nthe other players selected—heard they were good\nmuscle and wants the three to work together once\nto see how they do.

        "text": "By the time the characters complete the run,\neach of the characters has saved the others’\nhides and proved that he’s good at what he\ndoes. The characters develop respect for one\nanother, and when the next job comes through,\nVirgil rings up Teeth and Zero-One.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION OPTIONS\n\nThe following variations of the standard character-creation\nsystem suggest alternate methods that change the focus of char-\nacter creation in several ways. Most of these variations are\ndesigned to produce fairly balanced characters, but clever players\nwill undoubtedly find ways to use them to create characters with\nmassive combat abilities and few or no weaknesses or flaws. If\nsuch characters fit your style of play, by all means use them.\nOtherwise, gamemasters should carefully inspect characters cre-\nated with these rules to ensure that they do not upset the balance\nof play in their games.\n\nRaising and lowering priority costs is perhaps the simplest\n\nway to vary the character-creation system. In general, however,\naltering priorities in some way allows gamemasters to discourage\nor encourage the creation of certain types of characters that will\nsuit his campaign without restricting the players’ freedom to\nchoose.\nSpecifically for the sum-to-10 and point-based character\ndesign systems, we recommend that all piayers create their\ncharacters using the same creation system in order to maintain\ngame balance.\n\nALTERING RACE PRIORITIES\n\nThe More Metahumans option (p. 46, SR Il) recluces the pri-\nority of metahuman characters from A to C, thus providing play-\ners with added incentive to create metahuman characters.\nGamemasters who wish to keep metahumans a bit more uncom-\nmon in their games can lower the priority of “ordinary” metahu-\nmans to B and reserve Priority A for more “exotic” racial types,\nsuch as metahuman variants or shapeshifters (see pp. 36-44).\nAlternatively, gamemasters can assign different priorities to dif-\nferent Shadowrun races. For example, a gamemaster can assign\nPriority A to dwarf or elf characters, and Priority B to ork or troll\ncharacters. If desired, gamemasters can even eliminate the char-\nacter-race priority category. However, this variation may produce\nan overabundance of metahuman characters, most of whom pos-\nsess certain abilities superior to those of normal human characters.\n\nGamemasters who lower the priority for metahuman charac-\nters may choose to compensate for metahumans’ natural advan-\ntages by emphasizing the prejudice against and unique obstacles\nfaced by metahumans in the Sixth World. The gamemaster can\nachieve this by using such optional rules as the Racism and\nCharisma rules (p. 182, SRH) or the Prejudice rules on pp.\n137-40 in the California Free State sourcebook. While metahu-\nmans may be harassed by groups such as the Humanis Policlub,\nAlamos 20,000 and the Human Nation, gamemasters can also\ngive human characters trouble from human-hating metahuman\ngroups such as the Sons of Sauron.\n\nALTERING MAGIC PRIORITIES\n\nGamemasters can encourage the proliferation of magicians\nand adepts in their games by lowering the priority cost for creat-\ning these characters. Generally, any priority change should affect\nall magician and adept character types equally. In some circum-\nstances, gamemasters may wish to encourage or discourage spe-\ncific magical character types. For example, a gamemaster running\na tribal campaign may wish to encourage his players to design\nshaman characters by lowering the priority for shaman characters\nto B, keeping the priority of mage characters at A and adjusting\nthe priority cost for adepts accordingly. This variation provices\nshaman characters with an advantage over mage characters.\n\nLowering the priority cost for creating magically active char-\nacters can lead to the creation of very powerful magicians blessed\nwith Priority A Resources. Gamemasters should carefully consider\nthe effects of lowering priorities for magical characters before\ndoing so, and determine how to balance his game against such\ncharacters. In fact, gamemasters should reserve most magical-\ncharacter priority reductions for campaigns tailored to magic and\nmagician characters.\n\nALTERING ATTRIBUTE AND SKILL PRIORITIES\n\nAltering the cost of other priority categories often provides\nplayers with greater options when assigning their characters’\nAttributes and Skills.\n\nIf desired, gamemasters can also raise or lower the starting-\npoint limits for these categories to foster the creation of stronger\nor weaker characters. However, gamemasters can achieve these\nsame effects more simply by giving characters initial Karma\nbonuses to increase their skills and abilities before the game\nbegins, or by raising or lowering the initial Attribute and Skill rat-\ning limits (see Altering Rating Limits, p. 20).\n\nALTERING RESOURCE PRIORITIES\n\nGamemasters can change the amount of resources offered at\nany given priority to give characters greater or fewer resources at\nthe start of the game. Alternatively, gamemasters can set a stan-\ndard amount of resources that all characters receive. This variation\nallows the gamemaster to know in acivance how many nuyen all\nplayer characters will have to spend and to better jucige what\nequipment they will be able to purchase.\n\nGamemasters can also set specific equipment restrictions by\ncreating lists of approved equipment for starting characters. For\nexample, a gamemaster may allow starting characters to use any\ncyberware listed in SRI but restrict some of the cybertech and\nbioware items in the Shadowtech or Cybertechnology source-\nbooks, Or garnemasters can set general restrictions, such as “no\nbioware for starting characters.” Alternatively, gamemasters can\nset limits using the Availability ratings of equipment. For example,\na gamemaster may declare that starting characters may only pos-\nsess equipment of Availability 6 or lower. (In fact, Availability 6\nseems to be a workable equipment limit for most Shadowrun\ncampaigns.) Gamemasters may also set the equipment\nAvailability limit for their games at the same level as the initial\nAttribute and Skill rating limits. See Availability rules, p. 90.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComePeanton"

        "text": "ALTERING RATING LIMITS\n\nGamemasters can also shape the design of new characters by\naltering the rating limits on starting Attributes and Skills.\n\nLowering the rating limits from the standard upper limit of 6\ntends to result in characters who have many different skills and\nabilities but are masters of none. For example, a rating limit of 4\nproduces characters whose Skill ratings make them competent in\na few areas but who are no match for the more experienced and\ncapable character archetypes from SRII. However, such charac-\nters usually have the advantage of a greater variety of skills than\nthe archetypes. This variation works well for campaigns in which\nthe characters play gang members, corporate types forced into\nthe shadows, newshounds or newbie runners looking to make a\nname for themselves—pretty much anything except experienced\nshadowrunners.\n\nIncreasing the Skill and Attribute rating limits without\nincreasing the total available character-creation points enables\nplayers to create characters with extreme abilities and weakness-\nes. Under a rating limit of 8, for example, the system tends to pro-\nduce ultra-specialized characters such as a fantastic marksman or\ncomputer hacker who can't tie his own shoes without help. Such\ncharacters may be ill-suited for general play, but players and\ngamemasters may find them ideal for special campaigns or a sim-\nple change of pace.\n\nSUM-TO-10 SYSTEM\n\nIn the sum-to-10 system, each priority is replaced with a\nnumerical value between 4 and 0: A = 4, B = 3,C = 2,D = I, and\nE = 0. (Long-time Shadowrun players may recognize this varia-\ntion from the Shadowrun, First Edition rulebook.) Players set their\ncharacter priority levels however they desire, as long as the final\ncombined priority levels do not exceed 10. For example, a char-\nacter may have priority combinations of 4, 3, 2, 1,0; or 4, 4, 1, 1,\n0; or 3, 3, 3, 1, 0; or any other combination that adds up to 10.\n\nLike most of the other variations described here, the sum-to-10\nsystem can be abused, so the gamemaster should keep an eye on\nthe choices his players are making. This system provides the great-\nest opportunity for the creation of virtually invincible characters.\n\nPOINT-BASED DESIGN\n\nThe point-based system provides players with great flexibili-\nty when designing characters.\n\nThis system rests on a simple premise. In place of the stan-\ndard priorities—A, B, C, D and E—the gamemaster declares a\nBuilding Points allotment. Each player then uses his Building\nPoints to purchase his or her character's Race, Magic, Attributes,\nSkills and Resources. We recommend a Building Point allocation\nof 100.\n\nMagically capable characters created using the point-based\nsystem automatically receive 30 Force Points, rather than a num-\nber of Force Points based on the priority assigned to Resources\n(see also Magic, p. 21). While this results in characters that are\nalways less powerful at creation than identical characters created\nusing the priorities system, magical characters designed using the\npoint-based system are more appropriately balanced with other\ncharacter types in the game. In other words, they still kick butt,\n\nBUILDING POINTS TABLE\n\nComponent\nRace\nMetahuman 10\nHuman 0\n\nCost (in Building Points)\n\nMagic\n\nMagician 20 (30 Force Points)\n\nAdept 15 (30 Force Points)\n\nPhysical Adept 15 (Force Points equal to Magic Rating)\n\nAttributes 1 Attribute Point per 2 Building Points,\ngamemaster sets rating limits\n\n1 Skill Point per | Building Point,\ngamemaster sets rating limits\n\nResources\nAdditional Force\nPoints 2 Force Points per | Building Point,\ngamemaster sets rating limits\nNuyen\ni?) 5\n500 i?)\n5,000 5\n90,000 10\n15\n400,000 20\n25\n30\n\nbut not at the expense of game balance. Also, because players are\nnot forced to accept a certain number of Force Points in order to\nget a specific level of Resources or vice versa, they can more suc-\ncessfully tailor their characters to the background, team function\nand personality they desire.\n\nUsing this system, gamemasters still can restrict their players’\nchoices or encourage the creation of certain character types by\nsetting rating limits on characters’ Attributes and Skills. By adjust-\ning the starting Bullding Point amount, gamemasters can control\nthe general power of characters, The point-based system also pro-\nvides a convenient way to “handicap” players. For example, a\ngamemaster can make play more challenging for experienced\nplayers by reducing their starting Building Points and increasing\nthe Building Points of inexperienced or new players.\n\nThe Building Points Table suggests Building Point costs for\nvarious character components. For the costs of Edges and Flaws,\nsee Edges and Flaws, page 21.\n\nRace\n\nIf desired, gamemasters can vary the Building Point costs for\ncharacters of different metahuman races or add even more expen-\nsive races (see Altering Race Priorities, p. 19).\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPepantion"

At the gamemaster’s dis-\ncretion, players may gain additional Force Points at character cre-\nation by “buying” them at a cost of | Building Point for each 2\nForce Points.

Edges and Flaws\nenable players to modify and flesh out their characters by provid-\ning them with specific advantages (Edges) and disadvantages\n(Flaws). Unlike the character-creation variations described earlier\nin this section, Edges and Flaws do not represent an “across-the-\nboard” system of altering player characters; each individual play-\ner selects specific Edges and Flaws for his or her character, or may\ndecline to use this option at all. This allows Edges and Flaws to be\nused with any of the variant character-creation systems or with the\nstandard system provided in the Shadowrun rulebook.\n\nAs with any optional rule, gamemasters have the final say\nover which Edges and Flaws may be used in their campaigns, and\nmay prohibit the use of this option altogether.\n\nPURCHASING EDGES AND FLAWS\n\nPlayers purchase Edges and Flaws during character creation.\n(If desired, gamemasters may allow their players to add Edges\nand Flaws to their characters at any time during game play.\nBecause many Edges and Flaws actually represent things that\nmight happen to characters over the course of their lives, howev-\ner, we recommend that gamemasters require such advantages\nand disadvantages to be incorporated into existing characters\nthrough roleplaying.)\n\nEvery Edge and Flaw has a point value—Edges have positive\n(“plus”) values and Flaws have negative (“minus”) values.

        "text": "any combinations of Edges and Flaws whose combined point val-\nues equal zero. For example, a player might select Ambidexterity\n(2 points), Color Blind (—1 point), and Combat Monster (—1 point)\nfor his character.\n\nPlayers can purchase Edges and Flaws in the same manner\nusing the point-based character-creation system, or gamemasters\nmay allow their players to use Building Points when selecting\nEdges and Flaws. In this case, a player can spend Building Points\nto buy Edges or increase the number of Building Points he has\navailable by the point value of any Flaws he takes. For example, a\nplayer who takes the Flaw of Blind (-6 points) can add 6 Building\nPoints to his allowance.\n\nin the following Edge and Flaw descriptions, a positive value\nindicates an Edge and a negative value indicates a Flaw. The point\nvalues of all Edges and Flaws described in this section also appear\nin the Edges/Flaws Table on page 35.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nIn all cases, bonuses from Edges cannot raise Attribute, skill\nor Spell Force ratings beyond the standard rating limits and max-\nimums for new characters except with the gamemaster's\napproval. In cases where Edges and Flaws modify test target num-\nbers, target numbers can never be reduced below 2.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, Edges and Flaws cannot be com-\nbined. For example, a player cannot gain the advantages at char-\nacter creation that would be allowed by taking both the Pacifist\nand Total Pacifist Flaws for his or her character.\n\nThe High School Education Edge implies that unless a char-\nacter has this Edge, he or she may be considered to have only an\neighth-grade level of academic achievement. Depending on the\ntype of campaign the gamemaster runs and the desired back-\ngrounds of his players’ characters, an assumed lack of formal edu-\ncation might not fit the group's gaming style. The gamemaster\ncan handle this several ways, the easiest of which is simply to not\nallow education-based Edges and Flaws to be used in the game\n(Illiterate, Uneducated, High School Education, Technical School\nEducation, College Education). A lack of formal education does\nnot mean that a character Is stupid or illiterate, only that he or she\ndoes not hold a graduation certificate or other degree. A charac-\nter may be self-taught; he may have completed all the necessary\ncoursework for a certificate or degree but still owe the education-\nal institution money, allowing them to withhold the graduation\npaperwork; she may have been tutored at home and lack a cer-\ntificate from a recognized institution or may have finished her\nhigh-school equivalency degree studies but not taken the final exam.\n\nELIMINATING FLAWS\n\nWith enough effort, individuals can overcome nearly any bad\nhabit or learn to minimize the effects of innate physical or psy-\nchological disorders. To reflect this, gamemasters may give their\nplayers the option of eliminating their characters’ Flaws during the\ncourse of game play. If you use this option, make the characters\nwork hard to overcome a Flaw. Just like in real life, eliminating a\nFlaw should be a difficult and long-term process. For example, in\norder to eliminate an addiction, the character must endure a\npainful withdrawal process.\n\nMany Flaws can be eliminated or otherwise resolved with suf-\nficiently Involved campign setups and convincing, in-character\nroleplaying. In addition to any requirements the gamemaster sets\nfor permanently getting rid of a Flaw, the character must pay\nGood Karma equal to 10 x the Flaw’s point value. A character try-\ning to kick BTL addiction, for example, must go through the with-\ndrawal process and then pay 30 points of Good Karma (10 x 3-\npoint Flaw) to get the monkey off his back for good.\n\nSome Flaws also require medical attention or other radical\nprocedures to eliminate. The gamemaster determines the nuyen\ncost of these measures, which must be paid by the character in\naddition to the Karma cost. Players should keep in mind, howev-\ner, that eliminating one Flaw might just gain the character anoth-\ner: paying Karma and cash for surgery to remove the Night\nBlindness Flaw might result in an unexpected cortex bomb.\n\nDESIGNING EDGES AND FLAWS\n\nCustom-designed Edges and Flaws provide gamemasters\nand players with even greater opportunities to give characters dis-\ntinct traits. Use the Edges and Flaws described in this section as\nmodels when designing your own, In general, no Edge should be\nworth more than 6 points and no Flaw should be worth more than\n-6 points. Base the point value of new Edges and Flaws on each\none’s benefits or drawbacks. For example, an Edge that provides\na character with substantial benefits should have a high point\nvalue; an Edge that provides only minimal benefits should have a\nlow point value. Finally, all Edges and Flaws must be approved by\nthe gamemaster before players may use them in a game.\n\nStacy wants to create a character who's a\ndrop-dead gorgeous head-turner—a_ character\nwho gets noticed right away and uses her looks\nto get her way. The gamemaster, Bryan, likes the\nidea and suggests a new Edge to reflect the char-\nacter’s use of her stunning looks.\n\nHe calls the new Edge “Good Looking and\nKnows It.” He decides that the Edge provides a\n-2 target modifier on all Social and Etiquette\nTests made when dealing with members of the\nopposite sex (—1 target modifier when dealing\nwith members of the same sex). Furthermore.\nmembers of the opposite sex greet the character\nwith Friendly attitudes when they first meet her\n(see the Social Skill Table, p. 182, SRM).

(See Exceptional Attribute.)\n\nExceptional Attribute\nValue: 2\n\nA player can increase the racial maximum for one of his or her\ncharacter's Attributes by 1.\n\nNote that Exceptional Attribute simply raises the maximum—\nit does not increase the character's actual Attribute Rating to the\nnew maximum. To do that, players must take bonus Attribute\nPoints per the Bonus Attribute Point Edge. Further, the bonus\nAttribute Point used to raise the character's rating beyond the\noriginal racial maximum has an Edge value of 2.

The character must know the skill or be able to\ndefault to it through the Skill Web.\n\nCharacters may take Aptitude or Incompetence only once for\nany single skill. Gamemasters may also wish to limit characters to\n1 Aptitude, but should allow player characters to be incompetent\nin as many areas as the player wants, Closely monitor the use of\nAptitude-enhanced Combat, Magical and Computer skills, as\nthese can easily disrupt the balance of a game. In fact, gamemas-\nters may choose to prohibit players from using the Aptitude Edge\nwith certain skills to prevent such problems.\n\nIf possible, gamemasters should try to highlight characters’\nareas of Aptitude and Incompetence at least once per game.\n\nBonus Skill Point\nValue: 1\n\nFor | point, the character gains 1 bonus Skill Point, which he\ncan add to any skill.

The location must be either a\nsmall area—no larger than a single building—or an environment\nthat is encountered infrequently during the campaign. For exam-\nple, in a Seattle-based campaign, the desert would be an infre-\nquently encountered environment and could be considered home\nground for a displaced desert nomad character. The desert would\nnot be a suitable home ground in a campaign based in the magic-\nsoaked Mojave, however. Gamemasters must approve all home\ngrounds in their campaigns.\n\nFor a decker character, a home ground might be a particular\ncomputer system—a Matrix Host the decker knows extremely\nwell, for example. In this case, the character would receive the +1\ntarget modifier for all tests made while in that system. Favorite\ndata havens, particularly the Denver Nexus, also make suitable\nhome grounds for decker characters. Many corporate deckers\nhave the Home Ground Edge in their corporate systems.\n\nAll home grounds must be fixed locations—characters cannot\nmove them around. If a character's home ground is destroyed,\nthe character loses his Home Ground Edge.\n\nPHYSICAL EDGES AND FLAWS\n\nPhysical Edges and Flaws stem from a character's physical\nbody and capabilities.

A player character with this\nEdge may use it any time in combat.\n\nWhen employing Adrenaline Surge, the character uses the\nRule of Six for Initiative (p. 32, SRM) but receives a +1 target mod-\nifier on Combat Tests and Perception Tests made in combat situa-\ntions.

The character might have a fatal illness, be infected with a\nslow-acting poison or have a deadly implant such as a cortex\nbomb. In any case, the character's life span can be measured in\nmonths.\n\nWhenever a character takes the Borrowed Time Flaw, the\ngamemaster secretly rolls 3D6. The result indicates the number of\ngame months before the character dies. When the character's\ntime is up, he dies—nothing can save him. Give the character a\ndramatic death scene.\n\nIf the player changes his mind and wants his character to sur-\nvive, the gamemaster may allow the player to exchange\nBorrowed Time for another Flaw(s) worth -6 points. This option\nshould not be made available when the player chooses the Flaw,\nhowever, because knowing that Borrowed Time need not be fatal\neffectively negates any drama created by the character's knowl-\nedge of his impending death.

However, Natural\nimmunity provides no protection against man-made toxins and\nbiowarfare agents.\n\nNight Blindness\nValue: -2\n\nNight Blindness makes a character effectively blind at night or\nin darkness. In Full Darkness or Minimal Light conditions (see p.\n89, SRI), the character receives an additional +6 target modifier\nfor visual-based tests. Characters cannot take both Blind and Night\nBlindness.\n\nNight Vision\nValue: 1\n\nNight Vision provides human characters with improved night\nvision. Such characters can see normally in light levels as low as\nstarlight. However, total darkness (rare in twenty-first-century\ncities) still renders the user as blind as an individual with normal\nvision.\n\nParaplegic\nValue: -3\n\nParaplegic characters are paralyzed from the waist down.\nSuch characters can perform physical tasks that do not require the\nuse of their legs and can move around via wheelchair, but the\nParaplegic Flaw reduces their Combat Pools by half (round down).\n\nCharacters with the Paraplegic Flaw can and often do become\nhighly effective deckers, magicians and riggers.\n\nThe Paraplegic Flaw cannot be treated with cyberware.\nCharacters cannot take both Paraplegic and Quadriplegic.\n\nQuadriplegic\nValue: -6\n\nQuadriplegic characters are paralyzed from the neck down\nand cannot perform physical tasks of any kind.

Reduce the character's Body dice by | during tests made to\nresist diseases (the Body dice cannot drop below | on Resistance\nTests).

A character with -2 Amnesia cannot recall\nwho he is or anything about his past, but he retains the use of his\nskills and abilities. A character with —-5 Amnesia has no memory of\nhis past, including the skills and abilities he has learned.\nGamemasters should create character sheets for characters with\n-5S-point Amnesia, so that the player character does not know his\ncharacter's abilities, Attributes, and so on until he acts.\n\nBravery\nValue: 1\n\nCharacters with the Bravery Edge are not as easily frightened\nas most people.

Any time such a character is about to do\n\nsomething the gamemaster deems foolish, the gamemaster must\nwarn the player. A remark such as, “You might want to reconsid-\ner that,” would be appropriate.\n\nCompulsive\nValue: Variable\n\nCompulsive characters possess some compulsive behavior\nover which they have little or no control. The value of this Flaw\ndepends on how dangerous and troublesome the behavior is for\nthe character. For example, a character who is compulsively orga-\nnized isn't going to suffer much more than the occasional annoy-\nance of his teammates; his Compulsive Flaw will be worth no\nmore than —! point. By contrast, a decker who compulsively\nbreaks into high-level corporate Host systems would receive -3\npoints for his Flaw.\n\nFlashbacks\nValue: -4\n\nThe Flashbacks Flaw causes a character to experience vivid mem-\nory-based sensory hallucinations, known as flashbacks. These flash-\nbacks are always triggered by specific stimuli. For example, a charac-\nter who was tortured by the Universal Brotherhood might experience\nflashbacks of the torture whenever he or she sees an insect.\n\nAny time a character with Flashbacks encounters a potential\nflashback trigger, he or she must make a Willpower (6) Test. If the\ntest fails, a fashback occurs and incapacitates the character for\n1D6 minutes. The character cannot take any useful action during\nthat time.\n\nCharacters with the Flashback Fiaw should confer with their\ngamemasters to devise an appropriate flashback trigger before\nbeginning play. The trigger condition can be a particular sight,\nsmell, sound, taste, idea and so on. The condition should be\nsomething that the character will encounter a few times during a\ngame. If the trigger is too common, the character may end up\nexperiencing flashbacks all the time. If it is too rare, the character\nmay never experience any.\n\nHigh School Education\nValue: 1\n\nA character with High School Education attended high school\nand actually paid enough attention to remember a few basic\nthings, such as the table of the chemical elements, long division,\nand some pre-Awakening history.\n\nA character with High School Education can subtract | circle\non the Skill Web when defaulting to an Attribute for Knowledge\nSkills.

While\nunder the influence of the substance, the character may be mildly\neuphoric or totally incapacitated, depending on the substance.\nThe point value of an Addiction Flaw is based on the strength of\nthe substance’s addictive qualities or its effects on the character—\nStrongly Addictive, Debilitating or Incapacitating—as noted in the\nAddiction Table.\n\nAn addicted character who wants to “kick the habit” must\nspend a number of Karma Points equal to ten times the point\nvalue of his addiction (see Eliminating Flaws, p. 22.)\n\nAnimal Empathy\nValue: 2\n\nA character with the Animal Empathy Edge has an instinctive\nfeel for handling animals of all kinds. The character receives a —1\ntarget modifier for all tests that involve influencing or controlling\nan animal (including riding), Additionally, the character becomes\nreluctant to harm animals.

        "text": "At Ease\nValue: 3\n\nA character with the At Ease Edge can easily fit in with new\nsituations, new groups, new cities and new jobs. Whenever he or\nshe tries to fit into a new environment—infiltrating a group or try-\ning to meet contacts in a new city—the character may use his or\nher highest Etiquette Concentration appropriate for interactions.\nAny non-player character who fails a Perception (4) Test treats the\ncharacter like a local. Additionally, all non-player characters have\na Friendly attitude toward the character on any future tests (see\nthe Social Skill Table, p. 182, SRI).\n\nBad Reputation\nValue: -1 to -4\n\nA character with the Bad Reputation Flaw has a dark stain on\nhis or her reputation. Whether or not the stain is deserved, it\nmakes everyone react negatively to the character, The character\nreceives a +1 target modifier on all Social Skill Tests. Increase the\nmodifier by | for each point of Bad Reputation the character takes,\nup to a maximum of 4. For example, a character who takes —4\npoints of Bac Reputation receives a +4 target modifier.\n\nBlandness\nValue: 2\n\nThe Blandness Edge enables a character to blend into any\ncrowd. Anyone who attempts to describe the character cannot\ncome up with anything more precise than “he was kinda aver-\nage.”\n\nAny individual who attempts to track or physically locate the\ncharacter receives a +1 target modifier on all tests made during\nsuch attempts. The target modifier does not apply to magical or\nMatrix searches.\n\nDay Job\nValue: —1 to -3\n\nA character with the Day Job Flaw holds down a “real” job\nbesides shadowrunning. A character's day job burdens him or her\nwith responsibilities and time requirements, but it may provide\ncertain advantages as well. A day job can offer a convenient way\nto launcler money, a “cover” persona that can come in handy if\nlaw-enforcement people investigate the character, a network of\nnon-shadow contacts, and a little extra cash.\n\nIf desired, gamemasters may allow player characters to take\nup to -3 points of Day Job. The following guidelines provide sug-\ngested monthly salaries for day jobs. Feel free to adjust these fig-\nures and restrict the characters’ spending or choice of jobs.\n\nSUGGESTED DAY JOB SALARIES\n\nDark Secret\nValue: -2\n\nA character with the Dark Secret Flaw has some terrible secret\nwhose revelation could have dreadful consequences. Such a char-\nacter may have committed a horrible crime, may be the missing\nheir of a murdered crime family, or may have worked for an orga-\nnization such as the Universal Brotherhood or the Black Lodge,\njust to name a few possibilities. Every two or three game sessions,\nthe gamemaster must orchestrate an event that threatens to\nexpose the secret and forces the character to work to conceal it.\n\nIf a character's dark secret is exposed, the Flaw may be\nreplaced with a corresponding level of Bad Reputation at the\ngamemaster'’s discretion. Alternatively, the character may\nattempt to redeem himself.\n\nDependent\nValue: Variable\n\nA character with the Dependent Flaw has a loved one who\ndepends on him or her for support and aid from time to time.\nDependents may include children, parents, a spouse, a sibling or\nan old friend, Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a\nfair amount of the character's time, as well as some of the charac-\nter’s money. The gamemaster should set the point value of the\nFlaw, according to the needs of the dependent and the demands\nthose needs place on the character.\n\nDistinctive Style\nValue: —1\n\nA character with Distinctive Style has a flair for the dramatic\nin dress, behavior and speech, and simply can’t stand not being\nrecognized for his or her work. Understandably, this makes the\ncharacter dangerously memorable at times.\n\nA character who takes this Flaw must choose some way to\ndisplay his or her style. For example, a character might cultivate a\ndistinctive appearance by sporting a fluorescent green mohawk\nand a Soviet army jacket at all times. Whatever type of flair a char-\nacter selects, it must enable other individuals to easily remember\nthe character.\n\nElf Poser\nValue: -1\n\nElf Posers are human characters who want to be elves. This\ndesire prompts them to associate with elves as much as possible,\ntalk like elves, and alter their appearances so that they resemble\nelves.\n\nAn Elf Poser character starts the game with a poor command\nof Sperethiel; the character receives a +2 target modifier when\ntrying to understand or speak the language. Sperethiel-speakers\nwill laugh at the character's misspoken phrases (“You want to do\nwhat to my dog? ... oh, you're trying to say ‘let's get something\nto eat.\"\").

The character starts the game\nwith an extra contact who must reside in a foreign land. (Because\nthe default setting for Shadowrun is Seattle, the extra contact\nmust be from outside UCAS territory, unless the game is based in\nanother country.) Alternatively, gamemasters may allow extra\ncontacts to reside in any major city other than the home city of the\ncampaign. The character must make an effort to maintain this con-\ntact—this may be as simple as sending e-mail messages. The\ncharacter must indicate how he or she plans to maintain the con-\ntact when he or she takes the Edge, and the gamemaster must\napprove the method. If the character fails to appropriately main-\ntain the contact, he or she loses the contact permanently.\n\nAdditionally, the character can make new contacts in any for-\neign land he or she visits. To do so, the player chooses the individ-\nual contact (most likely someone his or her character worked with)\nand, as above, describes for the gamemaster how the character will\ncultivate that contact. The character must communicate with the for-\neign contact frequently for 1 year, then occasionally after that per\nthe Contact Upkeep rules, p. 62.\n\nFriends in High Places\nValue: 2\n\nCharacters with the Friends in High Places Edge have impor-\ntant, influential (Level 2) contacts—such as megacorporate VPs or\ngovernment officials. From time to time, such contacts can pro-\nvide considerable help to a character—much more than a regular\ncontact can provide. These contacts will not risk their own posi-\ntions to help a character, but will do anything short of that. A char-\nacter who abuses his or her high-ranking contact’s trust can quick-\nly lose this Edge, however.\n\nAt the gamemaster's discretion, a character can have an even\nhigher-placed contact, such as a megacorporate CEO. However,\nsuch individuals rarely have anything to do with lowly shad-\nowrunners. Friendships with such immensely powerful individuals\noften carry substantial risks as well as benefits.\n\nHuman-Looking\nValue: 1\n\nA metahuman character with the Human-Looking Edge can\n“pass” for human in most circumstances. Human non-player char-\nacters respond with Neutral attitudes toward such characters\nwhen making Social Skill Tests (p. 182, SRI). Additionally, human\nnon-player characters do not roll on the Racism Table (p. 182,\nSRM) when interacting with a Human-Looking character, unless\nthey are in close proximity to the character.\n\nOnly elves, dwarfs, and orks can take the Human-Looking\nEdge. Metahuman-variant characters (see Metahuman Variants,\np. 38) cannot take this Edge.\n\nHung Out to Dry\nValue: —4\n\nFor a reason chosen by the gamemaster, the character's con-\ntacts suddenly dry up—no one will talk to him or her. The charac-\nter can try to find out what happened, or simply get on with his or\nher life. Resoive the effects of this Flaw with roleplaying.\n\nIf desired, the resolution of this Flaw can become the subject\nof an entire campaign. Such a story line can provide an opportu-\nnity for the character to redeem his or her reputation among the\ncharacter's contacts, or further antagonize them until they become\nEnemies (see p. 71) and the character ends up with a permanent\nBad Reputation Flaw (p. 31).\n\nGood Reputation\nValue: 1 to 2\n\nDeservedly or not, the character with this Edge enjoys a Good\nReputation that makes others trust and respect him or her. For\neach point spent on Good Reputation, the character receives a -1\ntarget modifier for Social Skill Tests.\n\nUncouth\nValue: -2\n\nAn Uncouth character has no social graces, Such characters\nsuffer a +2 target modifier on Social Skill Tests (including\nNegotiation and Etiquette Tests).\n\nThis Flaw is common among street muscle-types, and many\nprofessional shadowrunners consider it the mark of an amateur.\n\nMAGICAL EDGES AND FLAWS\nBad Karma\nValue: -5\n\nA character with the Bad Karma Flaw lives under the weight\nof some black mark on his soul. This bad karma may result from a\npast transgression or simply the bad luck of being born under the\nwrong star.

The fol-\nlowing rules allow players and gamemasters\nto create shapeshifter characters and provide\nguidelines and examples for creating addi-\ntional metatypes. As always, gamemasters\nhave the final say on whether or not to\ninclude these new character types in their games\n\nCREATING A SHAPESHIFTER\n\nIn general, though some shapeshifters mingle with metahu-\nman society and even work as shadowrunners, most shapeshifters\nprefer to live in wilderness areas, apart from civilization\n\nThe Shapeshifter Character Creation Table illustrates the prior-\nity options available to shapeshifter characters. Note that all\nshapeshifter characters must assign Priority A to Race.\nShapeshifter characters purchase their base Attributes and skills\nper standard rules. Base Attribute Ratings may not exceed 6.\n\nNext, consult the Shapeshifter Attribute Modifiers Table and\ncalculate the character's final Attribute ratings. Apply the Human\nForm modifiers to the base Attribute ratings to determine the\nAttributes of the character in human form. Use the Animal Form\nmodifiers to calculate the Attributes of the character in animal\nform. These final Attribute ratings are not subject to any racial\nmaximums or other limits.\n\nThe table provides modifiers for the six shapeshifter species\ndescribed in SRI: Bear, Fox, Leopard, Seal, Tiger and Wolf.

As noted in the preceding section, shapeshifters\nreceive various Attribute bonuses in both animal and human\nforms.\n\nTo switch between forms, a shapeshifter must spend a\nComplex Action. The transformation from human to animal does\nnot include any of the shapeshifter's equipment or clothing; cloth-\ning will be ripped and equipment may be damaged during the\ntransformation if the character does not remove it first.\n\nWhen in animal form, a shapeshifter resembles a mundane\nmember of its species; only its astral presence distinguishes it\nfrom a mundane animal. A shapeshifter in animal form can com-\nmunicate with other members of its species, but cannot speak or\nuse Social skills. Shapeshifter magicians in animal form can cast\nspells, but cannot use Centering skills or fulfill geasa that their\nbeast-forms cannot perform.

If a\nshapeshifter takes Deadly Physical damage from Drain, the player\ncharacter rolls 1D6; the character dies on a result of | or 2.\n\nNote that these rules do not apply to damage from silver\nweapons (see Silver Allergy/Vulnerability, below).\n\nSHAPESHIFTER DISADVANTAGES\n\nShapeshifter player characters are hampered by three disad-\nvantages: their bestial natures, silver allergies and the inability to\nreceive cyberware implants.\n\nBestial Nature\n\nThough shapeshifters can assume human form, they are ani-\nmals at heart. Consequently, powerful animal instincts and emo-\ntions drive all shapeshifter characters. Even those who have\nlearned to speak metahuman languages and have assimilated into\ncivilized culture remain beasts at their core, and occasionally act\nin ways that may horrify even the most hardened shadowrunner,\n\nUnderstandably. most governments—including the UCAS,\nCAS and California aciministrations—do not grant shapeshifters\nmetahuman status. These governments consider shapeshifters no\nmore than wild animals. The NAN government accords more\ntights to shapeshifters, but does not recognize them as full citi-\nzens because of their inability to adhere to metahuman rules and\nsocial mores. In nearly all cases, government authorities do not\nhesitate to destroy criminal shapeshifters as they would a rabid\ndog.\n\nBecause of their bestial nature, shapeshifter player characters\ndo not receive the standard free contacts during character cre-\nation. Instead, they must purchase any starting contacts with their\nallocated Resource Points. However, few metahumans entirely\ntrust a shapeshifter.\n\nSilver Allergy/Vulnerability\n\nEvery shapeshifter has both a Severe Allergy and Vulnerability\nto silver. The mere touch of the metal causes a shapeshifter pain\nand burn-like welts. To withstand the urge to retreat from contact\nwith silver, a shapeshifter must make a successful Willpower (6)\nTest. Weapons made from silver or coated with it receive a +2\nPower bonus and a +1 Wound Level bonus against shapeshifters.\n\nFor example, a 4L knife made of silver would do 6M damage to a\nshapeshifter.\n\nAdditionally, shapeshifters recover damage caused by silver\nweapons at a rate of | Damage box per minute. Damage from sil-\nver weapons accumulates and kills a shapeshifter per standard\nrules. If a shapeshifter takes Deadly damage from a combination\nof silver and non-silver weapons, roll 1DG; the character dies on a\nresult of | or 2.\n\nCyberware Rejection\n\nShapeshifters cannot willingly accept any type of cyberware\nimplants. Their regenerative powers cause shapeshifters’ bodies\nto reject all cyberware as soon as they shift to animal form.\n\nParticularly sadistic rumor-mongers occasionally suggest that\nun-named governments have found a way to restrict criminal\nshapeshifters to their human forms by implanting cyberware into\ntheir human bodies in especially damaging ways.\n\nMETAHUMAN VARIANTS\n\nLike their human counterparts, metahumans come in a broad\nrange of colors, creeds and ethnic backgrounds, Nearly all possess\nthe basic metahuman qualities described in SRH, but members of\nmetahuman-variant subgroups may also possess unique charac-\nteristics. The following entries describe a few metahuman-variant\nsubgroups. Players and gamemasters can use these descriptions\nas guidelines for introducing different types of metahuman char-\nacters into their Shadowrun games.\n\nBecause they possess such unique physical characteristics,\neven other metahumans consider the metahuman variants\ndescribed in this book to be, well, freaks. These characters receive\na Hostile reaction (Social Skill Table, p. 182, SRE) in all initial social\ncontacts with other metahumans. Players and gamemasters also\nmust find creative ways for these characters to manage everyday\nlife—just where does a giant sleep, how does he hold a fork, how\ndoes he travel—heck, he can't even fit through most doors!\n\nMETAHUMAN ALBINISM\n\nThe condition of albinism continues to exist in the world of\nShadowrun, and all races manifest albino members. The typical\nmanifestations of an albino remain essentially the same: a defi-\nciency in skin and hair pigmentation, usually appearing as white\nhair or skin. and eyes showing a pink or blue iris with a bright red\npupil. In Shadowrun, albinos’ skin, eyes, and hair can also take on\na silvery hue, they are often noticeably thinner and taller than\naverage for their race, and they suffer a Mild allergy to sunlight.\nThere is no character creation priority change for albinism, though\nan albino character must have at least one of the following Flaws\n(see p. 25-27) without gaining the value of the Flaw in Build\nPoints or in an equal Edge: Bio-rejection, Color Blind, Low Pain\nTolerance, Night Blindness or Sensitive System. The player can\ntake more than one of the above Flaws for an albino character.\nEach additional Flaw beyond the required one provides the\nappropriate number of Build Points or can be balanced with an\nEdge. Albino characters have responded positively to the increase\nin mana and gain +1 to Willpower in addition to any other\nWillpower increase they receive at character creation.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComePeannion"

        "text": "SHILLS AND TRAINING\n\naf:\n\nn Shadowrun, a character's various skills largely define his or her overall abilities. Consequently, the\nuse and improvement of skills is one of the most important aspects of character development in\nShadowrun. This section presents material designed to fine-tune and expand the basic skill system\nto provide more satisfying play.\n\nThe section includes a revised version of the basic Skill Web, clarification of the Skill Web default\ntules and Dice Pool rules, and optional training rules that enable players to improve their characters’\nskills and Attributes during the course of play.\n\nREVISED SKILL WEB\n\nThe Skill Web (p. 69, SRII) is probably the most used—and abused—component of the Shadowrun\ngame system. The following revised Skill Web has been designed to correct a few of the most common\nproblems associated with the Skill Web, and reflects additions made to the game since the original Skill\nWeb was first published.\n\nThe revised Skill Web exchanges the positions of the Biotech and Cybertechnology skills, This\nchange reflects the fact that Biotech is used to provide first aid as well as basic medical treatment, while\nCybertechnology represents knowledge of advanced cybermedical procedures. This change makes\nBiotech relatively easier to default to, and makes defaulting to Cybertechnology as difficult as defaulting\nto the Computer and Electronic Build and Repair (B/R) skills.\n\nThe revised Skill Web includes the new Psychometry and Enchanting Skills Introduced in the\nAwakenings sourcebook. It also includes an extra dot between the Vehicle B/R Skills and the Reaction\n\nyg SHADOWRUN Comeanion"

        "text": "Attribute. This revision reflects the difficulty of building and repair-\ning a vehicle compared to the relative ease of driving one. The\nrevised Skill Web also contains the new skill Instruction, used\nwhen teaching or training a player character in a new skill (see\nTraining with an Instructor, p. 51).\n\nFinally, the new Skill Web enables characters to default to\nIntelligence for any B/R Skill Test.\n\nREVISED DEFAULT RULES\n\nLong ago, many Shadowrun players discovered they could\nuse the Skill Web rules to substitute other abilities for their char-\nacters’ skills and enable their characters to accomplish feats that\nthey would otherwise be incapable of performing. Such use of the\nSkill Web violates the basic idea behind it, however, and negates\nthe challenge of succeeding within a character's limitations. The\nfollowing rules and guidelines are designed to close the loopholes\nthat allowed such abuses and provide more challenging and\nrewarding play.\n\nDEFAULT SKILL/ATTRIBUTE LIMITS\n\nLimiting the feats that characters can perform with default\nskills or Attributes is one way that gamemasters can discourage\nplayers from misusing the Skill Web. Remember, a character uses\na default skill or Attribute in place of a specific skill suited to a par-\nticular task. However, the default skill/Attribute will never be suit-\ned to the task as well as the original skill. Therefore, the character\nshould not be able to accomplish the task as well as someone who\nuses the skill itself.\n\nFor example, just because a character can default to\nIntelligence from the Cybertechnology Skill does not mean that\nIntelligence alone should enable the average runner to sit down and\ndesign a delta-gracle move-by-wire system, Or take the case of a\nstreet samurai who's riding shotgun in his friend Zippy’s LAV. When\na lucky shot geeks Zippy, the street samurai must control the LAV\nhimself. He doesn't have the Vectored Thrust Skill, so he defaults to\nReaction to make the Vectored Thrust Test. With some luck, his high\nReaction might enable him to keep the craft in the air and maybe\neven land it safely. But without the Vectored Thrust Skill, he would\nnot know how to read the LAV’s control panei, use the LAN to plot\nway-points, or perform other acivanced piloting tasks,\n\nTASK-APPROPRIATE DEFAULT SKILLS\n\nThe Skill Web is simply a guide to linking loosely related\nskills. Most related skills share only a few similar aspects, and so\nevery gamemaster should use his or her own judgment to decide\nwhether any proposed default skill/Attribute is appropriate for a\ngiven task. If a player wants to default to a skill that is totally unre-\nlated to the task, the gamemaster may simply forbid it.\n\nCharlie wants to program the micro-control cir-\ncuitry on a new set of wired reflexes. Normally, this\nwould require a Cybertechnology Test, but Charlie\nlacks Cybertechnology, so he asks the gamemaster if\nhe can default to his Computer Skill for the task. The\ngamemaster approves. The two skills are connected\non the Skill Web, but more important, a character\n\nwith Computer Skill would plausibly have the knowl-\nedge needed to program such circuitry, So Charlie's\nComputer Skill would be appropriate for the task.\n\nLater in the garne, Diana decides she wants to\nimplant some cyberware into one of her fellow run-\nners, a task that normally requires a Cybertechnology\nTest, Diana doesn't have the Cybertechnology Skill\neither, so she asks the gamemaster if she can default\nto her Computer Theory Skill. The gamemaster\nrejects this request, because the Computer Theory\nSkill would not plausibly give a character the knowl-\nedge required to perform surgery.\n\nTask-Appropriate Modifiers\n\nIn cases where the appropriateness of a proposed default\nskill/Attribute is not as clear cut, gamemasters may allow the\ncharacter to use the default skill/Attribute but add a +1 task-\nappropriate target modifier to the test, The task-appropriate mod-\nifier is added to any other default modifiers for the test.\n\nOak needs to make an Etiquette (Street) Test to\nenlist the aid of some local gangers on a run, Oak\ndoesn't have that skill, so he asks the gamemaster if\nhe can default to his Leadership Skill. The gamemas-\nter okays the request. The two skills are not quite the\nsame, but he figures that a runner could use either\nskill to persuade some gangers to help him.\n\nHowever, the gamemaster also considers that\nthe gangers may not like being given orders (part of\nthe reason why the task calls for an Etiquette Test).\nTherefore, he adds a +1 target modifier to the test.\nAlong with the +2 target modifier for defaulting from\nEtiquette to Leadership, that produces a final +3 tar-\nget modifier for the test.\n\nFor roleplaying purposes, gamemasters should also consider\nhow the use of individual default skills/Attributes affects charac-\nters’ actions. In the preceding example, Oak would be likely to\nbark orders at the gangers, rather than persuade them to help.\nOak's approach, of course, will partially determine how the\ngangers react.\n\nPARTIAL DEFAULTING\n\nUnder the old Skill Web rules, a character with a low-level\nskill had two options when a test required using that ability. He or\nshe could simply use the skill against the test's base target num-\nber, or the character could use the Skill Web and default to a near-\nby skill or Attribute, accepting a higher target number in exchange\nfor more dice on the test.\n\nThe partial default rule provides a compromise between\nthese two choices. When partially defaulting to a skill or Attribute,\ncalculate the average of the original skill rating and the default\nskill/Attribute rating, The character then uses that average rating\nfor the test. The test target modifier equals half of the target mod-\nifier incurred for a standard default.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComePennion"

He calculates\nthe average of his Quickness and Athletics ratings\n(10 +2 = 12, 12 + 2 = 6) to determine his rating for\nthe test: 6. One dot lies between Athletics and\nQuickness on the Skill Web, which yields a +2 target\nmodifier on a standard default between the two.\nBecause Fenris is using the partial default rule, how-\never, the target modifier is only +1.\n\nFenris’s partial default enables him to roll 6 dice\nagainst a Target Number 5 for the test.\n\nDEFAULTING FROM\nCONCENTRATIONS/SPECIALIZATIONS\n\nNormally, a character attempting a task that falls outside of\nhis Concentration or Specialization would simply use his general\nskill for the task. In some cases, however, the difference between\nthe ratings of the character's general skill and his Concentration or\nSpecialization is quite large. In these cases, the character may\nwant to use the Skill Web to default to the general skill.\n\nTo default from a Concentration or Specialization to the gen-\neral skill, use the following rules. One dot separates each\nConcentration from its general skill on the Skill Web. Therefore, a\ncharacter who defaults to a general skill from a Concentration\nreceives a +2 target modifier for his or her test. Each Specialization\nis half a dot (+1 target modifier) away from its corresponding\nConcentration; thus, defaulting to a general skill from a\nSpecialization adds a +3 target modifier.\n\nKeep in mind that a character incurs no default modifier if he\nuses his own general skill rating for tasks that require one of the\nskill’s Concentrations or Specializations. Similarly, a character\nincurs no default modifier if he or she uses a Concentration for\ntasks that require one of a skill’s Specializations.\n\nIceman has Firearms 3, Firearms (Pistols) 5, and\nFirearms (Colt Manhunter) 7. On one particular run,\nhe finds himself facing an armored troll. He needs a\nbit more firepower than his trusty Colt can provide,\nso he picks up a nearby Ares HVAR rifle. The test has\na Target Number 4.\n\nSHADOWRUN COomPAaAniIoOn\n\nIceman's Concentration doesn't cover rifles, so\nhe has two options for the test. He can use his gen-\neral Firearms 3, or he can use the Skill Web and\ndefault from his Firearms (Colt Manhunter)\nSpecialization to Firearms. One and a half dots sepa-\nrate the two skills, so the test receives a +3 target\nmodifier for a final Target Number 7. That's higher\nthan the original target number, but Iceman’s\nFirearms (Colt Manhunter) 7 gives him more dice to\nroll as well.\n\nWhen Iceman sees that the HVAR is having lit-\ntle effect on the troll, he picks up a Panther assault\ncannon from a nearby corpse and takes aim. Again,\nthe test begins at a base Target Number 4. Because\nthe Panther is a heavy weapon, Iceman must default\nto the Gunnery Skill in order to use this gun, begin-\nning with either his general Firearms Skill (3 dice) or\nFirearms (Colt Manhunter) Specialization (7 dice).\nDefaulting from Firearms adds a +2 target modifier to\nthe target number (1 dot separates Gunnery and\nFirearms on the Skill Web). Defaulting from Firearms\n(Colt Manhunter) adds a +5 target modifier (2-1/2\ndots separate Gunnery and the specialization).\nBecause Iceman’s general Firearms rating Is only 3,\nhe decides to use his Specialization and make a\nFirearms (Colt Manhunter) (9) Test.\n\nOPTIONAL DICE POOLS\n\nDice Pools reflect the effects of Attribute or skill ratings on a\ncharacter's ability to perform a task. As experienced players\nknow, a Dice Pool provides extra dice that a player can add to\nthose normally allotted for a test. The basic Shadowrun rules offer\nfour types of Dice Pools: the Combat Pool, the Magic Pool, the\nControl Pool and the Hacking Pool. Each pool can be used to sup-\nplement a specific type of test. (See p. 32, SRI, for more details.)\n\nSome players feel that their characters are at a disadvantage\nin Shadowrun games because those characters lack a Dice Pool to\nsupplement their most important and most frequently used skills.\nThe following three Dice Pools provide examples of optional\npools that gamemasters may wish to add to their games to\naccommodate those characters. Feel free to create additional Dice\nPools to suit the specific conditions of your campaign.\n\nATHLETICS POOL\n\nPlayer characters can use dice from the Athletics Pool on any\nAthletic Skill Tests, such as Climbing and Lifting Tests.\n\nTo determine a character's Athletic Pool dice, add his or her\nQuickness and Strength Ratings, divide by 2 and round down. The\nnumber of Athletic Pool dice cannot exceed the character's base\nAthletics Skill Rating.\n\nSOCIAL POOL\n\nCharacters can use Social Poo! dice on any Social Skill Tests,\nsuch as Etiquette or Negotiation Tests.\n\nTo determine a character's Social Pool Dice, add his or her\nCharisma and Intelligence Ratings, divide by 2 and round down.\n\nes"

However, gamemasters can more accurately simulate the\ntime and dedication needed to improve a skill by requiring play-\ner characters to spend time training when they want to improve\nskills or Attributes.\n\nSKILL-IMPROVEMENT TRAINING\n\nUnder the training rules, the time a character must spend to\nimprove a skill depends on the type of skill being learned, as\nshown on the Skill Improvement Table.\n\nThe training time requirements apply to Concentrations and\nSpecializations in the skills as well. Every Concentration and\nSpecialization must be improved separately.\n\nCharacters can reduce the base training time by making a Skill\nTest using the skill they are improving (this test represents how\nquickly the character comprehends new topics and relates them\nto his existing ability in the skill). The base target number is equal\nto the new skill rating being trained for plus 2. If the character has\nused the skill often in game play, especially in stressful situations,\nthe gamemaster can apply a —1 target modifier to the Skill Test.\n(Gamemasters may adjust this modifier to suit the character and\ngame situation, if desired.) Characters may also reduce their train-\ning time by enlisting the aid of a live or virtual instructor (see\nTraining with an Instructor, p. 51).\n\nCharacters may also use the Skill Web to default to another\nskill or Attribute for the above test, per standard rules.\n\nTo calculate the final training time, divide the base time by\nthe number of successes achieved on the Skill Test. If the charac-\nter achieves no successes, multiply the base training time by 1.5\nand round up.\n\nGenerally, training time must be uninterrupted—otherwise\nthe required time period increases. If the character does not\n\nBase Training Time Required to Improve Skill (in days”\nRequired Karma Points spent x 7\nRequired Karma Points spent x 15\n\n=\n\ntrain for a number of days equal to\nhis or her Intelligence Rating plus the\nnew skill rating, he must allow for\nextra training time. The extra time\nequals the number of days remaining\nin the required training time, multi-\nplied by 2. This extra training time\nreflects how long the character must\nspend “getting back up to speed.”\nCharacters may incur extra training\ntime an unlimited number of times.\n\nSasser wants to raise her Medicine Skill from 2 to\n3. Medlicine is a Concentration of Biology, a knowl-\nedge skill, so the improvement will cost 4 Karma\nPoints. That means a required training time of GO days\n(required Karma Points 4 x 15 for knowledge skills).\nThat seems like a long time, so Sasser decides to make\na Medicine Test to reduce the required time. The\nTarget Number is 5 (new skill rating + 2). Sasser rarely\nuses her Medicine Skill, so the gamemaster declines to\nreduce the target number with a modifier.\n\nThe test yields 2 successes, which produces a\nfinal training time of 30 days (base training time of 60\ndays + 2). So, after training for 30 days, Sasser can\nspend 4 Good Karma Points to raise her Medicine\nRating to 3.\n\nAfter training for 25 days, however, Sasser\nneeds to go on a run. The run goes poorly, and\nSasser doesn't make it back to Seattle until 14 days\nhave passed. That's a problem. Sasser has\nintelligence 5, and the new Skill Rating is 3—so any\ntime she misses 8 or more days of training for the\nimprovement, she must add extra training time. She\nhad only 5 days left in the original training time when\nshe stopped, so she must now train for 10 days to\nimprove the skill (remaining days x 2 = extra train-\ning time).\n\nLEARNING A NEW SKILL\n\nThough the Shadowrun rules have always allowed player\ncharacters to learn new skills during the course of the game (post-\ncharacter creation), no guidelines existed to indicate what charac-\nters needed to do in order to gain new skills (see pp. 190-91,\nSRI) . Characters can learn new skills through self-directed study\n(the do-it-yourself method), or by training with a live or virtual\ninstructor. Generally, characters can use the do-it-yourself method\nto learn only skills related to those the character already possess-\nes (see the revised Skill Web, p. 47). At their discretion, however,\nindividual gamemasters may drop this restriction, limit it to cer-\ntain specific skills, or even expand the restriction.\n\nDO-IT-YOURSELF METHOD\n\nThe do-it-yourself method enables characters to learn new\nskills without the aid of an instructor. This method often makes\nlearning more difficult, and even dangerous at times (especially\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "when learning skills such as Demolitions, Biotech or Vectored\nThrust Piloting. to name a few). In addition to these common-\nsense examples, the gamemaster may otherwise restrict the\nchoice of skills that a character can learn on his own,\n\nThe base training time to learn a new skill is 30 days. A play-\ner can reduce this time for his characters by making a Skill (4) Test\nfor the new skill. Because the character does not yet possess the\nskill, the player must make the test with a related skill that the\ncharacter already possesses. (At the gamemaster’s discretion,\ncharacters may default to an Attribute for the test). All standard\ndefault rules and target modifiers apply.\n\nTo determine the final training time required to learn the new\nskill, divide the base training time (30 days) by the number of suc-\ncesses from the test. If the test yields no successes, multiply the\nbase training time by 1.5 to calculate the final training time. At the\nend of the training period, the character possesses the new skill.\n(Characters who interrupt their training may incur extra training\ntime, as noted in Skill-Improvement Training, p. 50).\n\nCharacters always learn new skills at Skill Rating 1.\n\nPhantom wants to learn Demolitions—in game\nterms, he wants Demolitions |. The gamemaster Is\nallowing characters to default to Attributes when\nleaming new skills, so the player running Phantom\ndecides to default to his character's Intelligence for the\ntest he makes to reduce the standard 30-day training\nperiod. On the Skill Web, 3 dots separate Intelligence\nand the Demolitions Skill, so the test target number is\n10 (base Target Number 4 + default modifier of 6). The\ntest yields 2 successes, and so Phantom’s final training\ntime is 15 days (30 days + 2).\n\nTRAINING WITH AN INSTRUCTOR\n\nInstructors can aid characters in two ways. First, they may\nenable characters to learn new skills they cannot learn on their\nown. Second, they can help reduce the training time required to\nimprove an existing skill or learn a new one.\n\nAny qualified character can serve as an instructor. The student\ncharacter can try to convince a friend to teach him or her a skill,\nenlist the aid of a contact, or seek out a professional instructor.\nFriends and contacts may accept favors in return for instruction.\nbut professional instructors usually demand nuyen for their ser-\nvices (see Instructor Fees, p. 52).\n\nInstructor Qualifications\n\nAn instructor must possess two basic qualifications. First, the\ninstructor must know the skill the student wishes to learn. If the\nstudent wants to improve a skill, the instructor must have a skill\nrating that equals or exceeds the rating the student wishes to\nachieve.\n\nSecond, the instructor should possess the Instruction Skill\n(see the Revised Skill Web, p. 47). An individual without the\nInstruction Skill can attempt to teach a skill, but the would-be\ninstructor must possess a Skill Rating 3 or higher in the skill he or\nshe is teaching. When training a student who wants to improve a\n\nskill, the instructor must possess a skill rating at least 2 levels\nhigher than the skill rating he or she Is attempting to teach.\n\nTeaching\n\nWhen teaching a new skill or helping a character improve an\nexisting skill rating, an instructor makes an Instruction (4) Test. If\nthe instructor does not possess the Instruction Skill, he or she\nmakes a test using the skill being taught with a +4 target modifi-\ner. For every 2 successes that either test generates, add | to the\nstudent's Skill Test success total, for purposes of reducing the stu-\ndent's required training time.\n\nIf the Instruction Test or Skill Test generates no successes, the\ninstructor simply cannot teach the student. To simulate this failure\nin the game universe, the student must compensate the instruc-\ntor for his or her efforts by forfeiting | day's worth of pay to the\ninstructor, and must also add 1.5 days to his training time for the\nskill—this represents the character's disappointment at failing\nwith one instructor and the need to shift gears to find another\nteacher, not to mention the nuyen spent on the first instructor. The\ngamemaster can use any number of reasons to explain the failure\nin roleplaying terms—the instructor and student may have philo-\nsophical differences, the instructor's methods may clash with the\nmaterial, or the two characters may distrust one another or simply\nbe incompatible.\n\nCharacters who are learning a new skill with the aid of an\ninstructor also receive a —| target modifier on their Skill Tests for\nlearning new skills.\n\nAn instructor must train with the student for the student's\nentire training time. If the instructor leaves before the student\nhas completed the training, double the remaining training time.\nThis increase represents the greater difficulty of learning on\none’s own.\n\nInstructor Fees\n\nInstructor fees present a convenient way for gamemasters to\ncurb characters that may threaten game balance by accumulating\nmassive skill sets. The Suggested Instructor Fees Table provides\nsuggested daily instructor fees, but gamemasters should modify\nfees as they see fit. After all, better instructors will command high-\ner fees than mediocre instructors, and instruction in rare or highly\nprized skills will cost more than instruction in common skills.\n\nScarecrow wants to improve his Armed Combat\nSkill Rating from 3 to 4. Armed Combat is a general\nskill, so the increase costs 8 Karma Points. That\nmeans the base training time is 56 days (8 x 7 = 56).\nScarecrow makes an Armed Combat (6) Test to\nreduce the time and achieves 2 successes, That\nbrings the training time down to 28 days (56 + 2).\n\nHowever, Scarecrow has arranged for Oak, a fellow\nrunner, to teach him Armed Combat. (Oak has Armed\nCombat 6, so he's qualified to teach Scarecrow at Armed\nCombat 4.) Oak achieves 2 successes on his Instruction\nTest, so Scarecrow adds an extra success to his Armed\nCombat Test result. That brings the training time down to\n18 days (56 = 3).\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion"

The program cannot make an Instruction Test to\nreduce the student's base training time, but all other standard\ninstructor rules apply. Perhaps the most important advantage a\nvirtual instructor offers is that a character can purchase a chip with\na very high skill rating and then use that same program when\ntraining for multiple advanced ratings in a single skill\n\nTo determine the cost of a virtual-instructor program, com-\nbine the program's effective skill rating and Instruction rating and\ndivide the sum by 2 (round up) for the average rating, then con-\nsult the Skill Memory Table (p. 248, SRM) to determine the Mp\nsize of the program. Calculate the cost in nuyen by multiplying the\nprogram's Mp by 5\n\nTo reflect the difficulty of obtaining virtual-instructor pro-\ngrams for skills that are inherently illegal or restricted (such as\nDemolitions, Military Vehicle Skills, or high-level Firearms and\nWeapons Skills), treat such programs as if they have Street\nIndexes of 2 and Availability Ratings of 10.\n\nSHADOWRUN COomPAaAnION"

        "text": "SHIL Lsanb\n\nSimilarly, skill chips are not readily available for general skills\nrated at 6 or higher, Concentrations of 7 or higher, and\nSpecializations of 8 or higher. Treat such skills as if they have\nAvailability Ratings of 10 or higher and Street Indexes of 1.5 (such\nchips may not be illegal, but they are hard to acquire).\n\nWraith decides he wants to raise his Biology\n(Zoology) Rating from | to 2. He goes to the local\nChips ‘R’ Us. He finds the best Zoology virtual-instruc-\ntor program on the market; the gamemaster decides it\nhas an Instruction Rating 6. The chip contains enough\ndata to bring a character up to Zoology 3, so it has an\neffective Skill Rating of 3.\n\nThe two ratings produce an average of 4.5,\nrounded up to 5. The gamemaster then consults the\nSkillsoft Memory Table. A Rating 5 General\nSkill/Concentration chip contains 150 Mp, so the\ntraining chip costs 750¥ (5 x 150). That's a pretty\ngood deal, because Wraith can re-use the chip later if\nhe wants to raise his Zoology Rating to 3, and he\nwon't have to spend more nuyen.\n\nTRAINING DAYS\n\nA standard training-time “day” is 4 hours. Thus, a training\ntime of 30 days equals 120 hours of study.\n\nA character who is particularly eager to learn or improve a\nskill can train for more than 4 hours a day, though no metahuman\ncan train 24 hours a day. A character's daily training limit equals\nhalf of his or her Willpower (rounded up) + 4.\n\nCharacters can train beyond their daily training limit, but such\ntraining may prove ineffective. A character who wants to train in\nthis manner must declare how many hours beyond his limit he\nintends to train. To determine how many of these hours will pay off,\nthe character makes a Willpower (10) Test. The result is the number\nof extra hours of effective practice the character can put in beyond\nhis or her daily training limit. No matter what the test result, the\ncharacter may not exceed his declared extra practice time.\n\nTo determine the number of days the character will need to\ncomplete his training at the new pace, simply divide the total\nnumber of hours in the training time by the character's total daily\ntraining period.\n\nRemember Scarecrow? He needed 18 days to\nimprove his Firearms Skill (that comes out to 72\nhours). Scarecrow is impatient, however, and he has\nlots of time on his hands. Consequently, he decides\nto spend 10 hours a day training. He has Willpower\n6, so his maximum daily training limit is 7 hours ([6\n+2) +4).\n\nTo determine how many of the extra 3 hours\nwill be effective, Scarecrow makes a Willpower (10)\nTest. The test yields 1 success. That means each day's\ntraining session will yield 8 hours of effective training\n(even though Scarecrow slogs away for 10 hours).\n\nHowever, the extended daily training sessions\nreduce Scarecrow's training time to 9 days (72 + 8).\n\nIMPROVING ATTRIBUTES\n\nIf desired, gamemasters may allow player characters to\nimprove their Attributes in the same manner they improve skills.\n(For roleplaying purposes, the player character will need to devise\nsome way to “work out” using the Attribute. For example, a char-\nacter might lift weights for several hours each day to improve his\nor her Strength. In all cases, the gamemaster determines if a pro-\nposed training regimen is appropriate.)\n\nThe base training time to improve an Attribute is the same as\nthe base training time for an active (non-knowledge) skill (7 days\ntimes the number of Karma Points required for the improvement).\nSee p. 190, SRH, for Karma costs of Attribute increases. To reduce\nthe training time, a player character can make an Attribute (6)\nTest, using the Attribute he or she is improving.\n\nGenerally, player characters can raise their Attributes without\nthe help of instructors. However, gamemasters may require that\ncharacters use an instructor if they want to raise an Attribute to its\nracial maximum or beyond. Gamemasters may also require that\ncharacters use instructors when increasing their Willpower,\nIntelligence or Charisma Ratings.\n\nInstructor rules and fees for Attribute training are generally\nthe same as for skill training. However, the instructor skill qualifi-\ncations do not apply. Instead, the instructor must possess an\nInstruction Skill Rating that exceeds the Attribute Rating the stu-\ndent wants to achieve. (The instructor's ability to motivate the stu-\ndent is much more important than his own skill during Attribute\ntraining.)\n\nGolden Eyes wants to raise her Charisma Rating\nfrom 5 to 6. The increase costs 6 Karma Points, which\ngives her a base training time of 42 days (6 x 7 = 42).\nGolden Eyes is human, so her racial maximum for\nCharisma is Rating 6. Because she’s going for the\nmaximum, the gamemaster insists that she train with\nan instructor.\n\nAfter a little asking around, Golden Eyes finds\nMizz Manners, a troll who “can take a ghoul and\nmake it Miss Universe.” Mizz Manners puts Golden\nEyes on a regimen of hard-core socializing. Golden\nEyes spends her nights hopping between the hippest\ngallery openings, the trendiest clubs and the most\nexclusive parties. During her days, Golden Eye rigor-\nously trains to polish her manners, speech and dress,\nand reads up on sophisticated conversational topics.\n\nTo reduce the length of her training period.\nGolden Eyes makes a Charisma (6) Test. The test\nyields 2 successes. Meanwhile, Mizz Manners\nachieves 2 successes on her Instruction (4) Test. She\ncan contribute | success to Golden Eye's Attribute\nTest success total—which brings it up to 3. That\nmeans Golden Eyes’ training time drops to 14 days\n(42 + 3).\n\n3)\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPpaAaAnion"

They are generally dependable, rea-\nsonably loyal to Fuchi as a source of steady income, and tend to\napproach contract negotiations amiably. A long-term supplemen-\ntal resource may only be used with the approval of this depart-\nment's Head Resources Adjuster. As a matter of policy, Fuchi per-\nsonnel who have recently gained access to the Resources\nAdjustment Department are restricted to working with short-term\nor expendable supplemental resources until the Head Resources\nAdjuster deems the client experienced enough in working with\nSRs to have developed the proper attitude toward them.

In either case, they are considered possible\nsecurity breaches and must be watched closely for any sign of dis-\nloyalty. A short-term SR who demonstrates willingness to work at\na high professional standard for Fuchi America will be evaluated\nby RAD staffers and may be raised to long-term status. As long-\nterm assignments pay considerably more than short-term assign-\nments, many new short-termers are strongly motivated to per-\nform well on the job.\n\n© Where do | sign up?\n© BCP@NA/UCAS-NE.datastorm.com\n\n© Mail Ager at “AgerW@NA/UCAS-NE.fuchi.com” and ask him for\najob.\n© Sidekick\n\n© Hey, Sidekick. there’s something dripping off of your chin ... you\nmight want to clean it up.

Most\nclients will deal with short-term SRs, who are not known for treat-\ning potential employers with respect. To compensate for this treat-\nment, the RAD offers the following guidelines for business success:\n\nTREAT THE SRS AS HOSTILE. Even if they appear wholesome\n{a statistically improbable occurrence), assume that they are will-\ning to kill you for any trivial reason should the opportunity present\nitself. These people are hardened criminals who commit heinous\ncrimes for nuyen. They are mercenaries, living merely for the next\npayment, and they will try to squeeze you for all they can get.\nRemember that every nuyen you pay them Is one less nuyen for\nFuchi America. They are tools, no more; your job is to get as much\nwork out of them as possible while compensating them as little as\npossible.\n\nNo matter how well they may present themselves, these are\nnot honorable, decent people. As criminals, they have no claim to\nfair treatment or respect. Treat them like the beasts they are; toss\nthem their dinner from a safe distance and make sure that Fuchi\nAmerica does not get bitten. If you think of them as being “just\nlike us” even for a moment, you have already failed.\n\n© The Ager paranoia surfaces again.

If the SRs recognize you or your\naffiliation, they may attempt to blackmail you at a later date. Such\na development would be harmful to you and to Fuchi America.\nDepartmental research indicates that SRs are prone to make snap\njudgements about clients based on observations they make at the\ninitial meeting. The RAD therefore supplies “plainclothes” for\nthese meetings—generic suits of a conservative cut that cannot be\neasily identified as contemporary corporate fashion.\n\nIf the situation calls for a greater degree of misdirection, RAD\nstaffers can suggest various ensembles and accoutrements that\nincorprate the hallmarks of other corporations or organizations.\nCosmetic changes can also be made at a client's request, includ-\ning wigs, contact lenses, melanin pills to change skin tone, and so\non.

When bargained\ndown within this overhead, the SRs will believe they are receiving\n150 percent of the initial offer, which should be sufficient to satis-\n\nfy even the greediest of these criminals. DO NOT UNDER ANY\nCIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THIS 25 PERCENT OVERHEAD. There\nare always more SRs than there are assignments available, and\nFuchi America’s profits must always be the prime consideration, If\nthe asking price of any given group of SRs exceeds the overhead,\nwalk away from the meeting. Notify the RAD, and our staffers will\ncontact another group of SRs ASAP.\n\n© Does everybody understand that? If you get greedy, you'll get\ndrek!\n© Death Ange!\n\nHOW CAN I GUARANTEE SUCCESS?\n\nStrictly speaking, you cannot guarantee success. You can,\nhowever, maximize the opportunity for success to occur by fol-\nlowing the guidelines we've put together and keeping a few facts\nin mind. First of all, no SR can be fully trusted. Even long-term SRs\nwith excellent track records are not Fuchi employees, and should\nnot be afforded the trust given to members of the Fuchi\nCommunity™,\n\n© Oh man, | think I'm gonna Yarf™!\n© Bung\n\n@ Me too. “Maximize the opportunity for success to occur”\n<<THROWUP-NOISE WAVE>>\n© WyrdNyrd\n\nStatistically, 98 percent of all short-term SRs have satisfactorily\ncompleted their assignments for our clients. The RAD has achieved\nthis excellent success rate with our Keep An Eye Out surveillance\nprogram, founded in 2037 to prevent breaches of contract. (This\nprogram should not be confused with the Put An Eye Out cam-\npaign, established in 2054 to combat unauthorized trid broadcasts\nfrom Fuchi facilities by non-Fuchi employees.) The KAEO program\nuses sophisticated surveillance gear and techniques to keep track of\nSR teams, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\nCredsticks with Active On Demand™ locator bugs. When the\ncredstick logs a transaction, the signal activates a trace program\nthat heads for the nearest Fuchi domain. The trace program lets\nKAEO personnel instantly ascertain the whereabouts of any SR\nusing an AOD credstick.\n\nHigh-altitude surveillance drones.

The credsticks serve as target beacons for\nthe drones, allowing them to patch Into the Global Positioning\nSystem and track the movements of the SRs within 1.25 meters.\n\nWatcher spirits. These spirits report any and all unusual activ-\nity of an SR directly to RAD mages.

Furthermore, gamemasters can use contacts to make the Shadowrun world a fuller,\nmore colorful place to play. Despite those advantages, many Shadowrun groups don't exploit the full\npotential of contacts. Too many gamemasters don't take the time to flesh out their players’ contacts, and\ntoo many players never even consider exploring the roleplaying opportunities contacts provide. Character inter-\nactions with contacts remain nothing more than Etiquette Tests and the expenditure of a few nuyen.\n\nMaking contacts into fully realized characters—\"fieshing them out,” in other words—is the key to getting the\nmost from contacts. To achieve this, gamemasters must spend a little time creating a background for each of their\nplayers’ contacts.\n\nDeciding what a contact does when he's not providing information to curious runners is a good place to\nstart. Giving each contact a few Edges or Flaws from the Character Creation section (p. 21) or giving a contact\na catch-phrase archetype title—such as Former Wage Slave, Company Man, Street Doc, Combat Mage,\nMercenary, Detective, or Bodyguard—can help make the contact a distinct personality.

A contact might also turn the tables and ask a runner\nfor a favor, Find a way to make it clear that contacts have lives of\ntheir own. They don’t just sit around and wait for runners to call.\n\nCONTACT LEVELS\n\nThe basic Shadowrun rules classify contacts into three\ngroups—standard “contacts,” “buddies” and “followers.” These\nclassifications provide a way to broadly reflect the relationship\nbetween a runner and a contact. Unfortunately, these classifica-\ntions do not always provide an adequate reflection of runner/con-\ntact relationships. A contact may be an old friend, but according\nto the standard rules, a poor result on an Etiquette Test may keep\nthat old friend from revealing what he or she knows.\n\nThe following contact levels are designed to aciciress this short-\ncoming by better reflecting the relationships between runners and\ncontacts. Each level provides a runner with distinct advantages and\ndisadvantages when dealing with his contact. The “upkeep” figure\nrepresents the amount of nuyen a runner must spend maintaining\nthe contact each year (see Contact Upkeep, below).\n\nLEVEL 1 CONTACT\n\nThe Level | contact is basically the standard Shadowrun con-\ntact (p. 43, SRI). Level | contacts function like real-life “acquain-\ntances.” A Level | contact may know information that a character\nneeds and will probably reveal it—but he may keep it to himself\njust because he cloesn't feel any particular loyalty to the character.\n\nOn the other hand, a Level | contact is less likely to remem-\nber a runner's identity or even existence when the “bad guys”\ncome a-callin’. And if the contact does remember the runner, he\nis very unlikely to have any idea where the runner can be found.\n\nAdvantages: The gamemaster may make an opposed\nIntelligence (6) Test for the contact to determine if the contact can\nrecall information about the runner when asked. The gamemaster\nmay modify the target number as he sees fit.\n\nUpkeep: 500 nuyen\n\nLEVEL 2 CONTACT\n\nA Level 2 contact knows the runner and sees him on a semi-\nregular basis. The runner and contact have developed a certain\nlevel of trust, and the contact will remain loyal as long as he does\nnot have to stick his neck out too far on the runner's behalf. A\nLevel 2 contact will always provide the information a runner is\nlooking for and may even “keep his ear to the ground” for a run-\nner if he has the time.\n\nLevel 2 contacts are considered “buddies” for purposes of\ncharacter creation.\n\nAdvantages: A runner receives | extra die for any Etiquette\nTests made to acquire information from Level 2 contacts. In acdi-\ntion, the gamemaster may make an opposed Willpower (5) Test\nfor the contact to determine if the contact can successfully refuse\nto answer questions about the runner.\n\nUpkeep: 3,000 nuyen\n\nLEVEL 3 CONTACT\n\nA Level 3 contact is more than a buddy—she’s a friend for\nlife. A runner may have grown up with her Level 3 contact in the\nSeattle sprawl, or the runner may have pulled the contact's near-\nly fried hoop out of a Lone Star fire fight. A Level 3 contact knows\nthe runner well and interacts with him or her on a regular basis.\nThe character may not even think of his or her friend as a contact,\nbut what that person does or knows will surely be useful to the\nrunner at some point.\n\nAdvantages: A runner receives 2 extra dice for Etiquette\nTests made to acquire information from his or her Level 3 con-\ntacts. In addition, the gamemaster may make an opposed\nWillpower (G) Test for the contact to determine if the contact can\nsuccessfully refuse to answer questions about the runner.\n\nUpkeep: 7,000 nuyen\n\nCONTACT CREATION COST\n\nUnder the standard Shadowrun rules, every player can\nchoose 2 free contacts for his or her character during character\ncreation, These free contacts are considered Level | contacts, as\nare all other contacts purchased during character creation (see p.\n46, SRI). All “buddies” obtained during character creation are\nconsidered Level 2 contacts. (“Followers,” including tribe and\ngang members, are not considered contacts.)\n\nAs stated in the rules, player characters may not purchase con-\ntacts after character creation. Any contacts gained during the course\nof a game or campaign must be acquired through roleplaying.\nIndividual gamemasters and players should determine the details of\nmeeting contacts in this manner. As a rule of thumb, however, new\ncontacts should be Level | contacts. Only rarely should circum-\nstances permit characters to gain new contacts at Level 2, Under no\ncircumstances should new contacts start as Level 3 contacts.\n\nPlayers must pay the appropriate upkeep costs for all con-\ntacts gained during character creation from their starting nuyen.\nFor example, a player who wishes to raise a free Level 1 contact\nto a Level 3 contact must pay a total of 10,000 nuyen (combined\nLevel 2 and Level 3 upkeep costs = 10,000).\n\nCONTACT UPKEEP\n\nContacts are people too, and characters must treat them as\nsuch. Contacts are not simply handy sources of information that\ncan be ignored until the character needs to learn the identity of\nthe new sales VP at the Big Pyramid or the latest scuttlebutt at the\nlocal Lone Star station. If a character treats her contact as nothing\nmore than a convenient reference to be consulted like a book, that\ncontact will eventually become disillusioned and uncooperative,\n\nKeeping a contact happy is known as “contact upkeep.”\nContact upkeep is a two-part process, Part | consists of roleplay-\ning. The gamemaster decides what constitutes adequate contact\nupkeep in terms of a player's portrayal of his or her character's\nrapport with, concern for and relationship to a contact. Generally,\ncharacters simply need to treat their contacts with the respect\nthey deserve in order to maintain them. Characters need not\nshower their contacts with gifts or visit them every day of the\nweek. But they should treat the contact to a soykaf every once in\na while or slide him a loan when he needs one.\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion\n\nachat"

        "text": "Part 2 consists of spending the required annual upkeep cost\nto maintain the contact. Characters can Pay a contact’s required\nupkeep cost over the course of a game year. Characters can use\nupkeep nuyen to buy their contacts drinks or dinner, do the occa-\nsional favor, or simply give the contact an occasional credstick.\nBasically, anything that’s worth hard nuyen can be considered part\nof the upkeep payment for a contact. For example, the value of\nletting your buddy know that he should sell his Ares stock\nbecause you expect it to take a major dive now that the corp's hot\nnew drone prototype happens to be sitting in your bedroom clos-\net may be equal to an entire year's upkeep cost. Gamemasters\ndetermine the value of such favors, advice, services and so on.\n\nA contact's level drops if a character fails to spend the\nrequired upkeep nuyen on him, or if the gamemaster determines\nthat the character has failed to adequately maintain the contact\nwith roleplaying. Gamemasters should feel free to create addi-\ntional, unique requirements for maintaining contacts in their cam-\npaigns.\n\nIf a Level 2 or Level 3 contact drops a level, a character can\nregain the contact's previous level by using the rules in Improving\nContact Levels.\n\nA gamemaster has at least three options when a character\nfails to maintain a Level | contact, and may use any one or all\nthree options at his discretion. The character may simply never\nhear from the contact again; in that case, the character cannot use\nthe contact or any of the contact’s contacts for information (see\nFriends of a Friend, below). The contact can become the charac-\nter's Enemy (see p. 71), The character may also earn him- or her-\nself the Bad Reputation Flaw (see p. 31).\n\nIf a character loses all his or her contacts by failing to fulfill\nupkeep requirements, the character receives the Flaws Hung Out\nto Dry and Bad Reputation (pp. 32, 31). Increase by | the Priority\nlevels of all the character's Enemies as well (see Enemies, p. 71).\n\nBilly Boy, just your average mercenary looking\nto make a name for himself, starts the game with 2\ncontacts. Joe is the bartender down at Droogies,\nwhere Billy Boy likes to spend his extra nuyen,\nTimmons is a Lone Star beat cop, who's actually a\nLevel 2 buddy. (Billy Boy once dated Timmons'’s sis-\nter. Billy Boy and Timmons got along real well, and\nremained friends even after Billy Boy and the sister\nbroke up.)\n\nBilly Boy spends plenty of time and nuyen at\nDroogies, and he tips well. Consequently, the\ngamemaster decides that Billy doesn't have to spend\nadditional nuyen or go out of his way to maintain Joe\nas a Level | contact.\n\nTimmons, however, is a Level 2 contact, so Billy\nhas to make more of an effort to maintain him.\nBesides taking Timmons out on the town and buying\nhis drinks on a semi-regular basis, Billy tips him off to\nsmall-time criminals like the “no-good ganger kids”\nwho harass the elderly and occasionally rob the\nmom-and-pop diners where Billy Boy gets his cheap\n\neats. When Billy's gamemaster decides these things\nmay not be enough to maintain a Level 2 contact,\nBilly decides to fix up Timmons with a nice chica he\nknows down Tacoma way. The gamemaster thinks\nthis is a creative idea and decides that as long as\nTimmons and the girl continue to see each other,\nBilly need only spend half the usual upkeep cost buy-\ning drinks for Timmons.\n\nIMPROVING CONTACT LEVELS\n\nTo improve a contact's level during the course of play, a char-\nacter must pay the upkeep cost of the contact’s current level, as\nwell as the cost of the contact’s new level. For example, a charac-\nter who wants to raise his Level 2 buddy to a Level 3 contact must\npay a total of 10,000 nuyen (Level 2 cost of 3,000 + Level 3 cost\nOf 7,000). The character then must also pay the standard upkeep\ncost to maintain the contact.\n\nAlternatively, gamemasters may allow characters to improve\nthe level of their contacts by spending Karma. When using this\noption, the character must spend a number of Karma Points equal\nto twice the new level. For example, a character using Karma to\nimprove a Level I contact to a Level 2 contact would have to\nspend 4 Karma Points. Improving a contact to Level 3 would cost\n6 Karma Points. Contacts cannot be improved more than | level\nin this manner. The character then must also pay the standard\nupkeep cost to maintain the contact.\n\nGamemasters must approve all contact level improvements,\nbased on the fictional relationship between character and contact.\nA contact who only occasionally sees a character and who does\nnot have a particularly friendly relationship with that character is\nnot an appropriate choice for a Level 3 contact.\n\nFRIENDS OF A FRIEND\n\nBecause contacts have lives of their own, they have contacts\nof their own as well. These secondary contacts, one step removed\nfrom the characters, are known as Friends of a Friend (FOFs). Thus,\nBilly Boy from the preceding example not only has access to any\nhelp Joe and Timmons can give him, he also has access to the\npeople that Joe and Timmons know. These people are Billy's FOFs.\n\nFOFs provide more options to characters, more color and\nbackground to games, and more realism. For example, Joe the\nbartender wouldn't realistically have a stockpile of Ares’ finest\nweapons organized next to the synth-alcoho!l on the shelf.\nHowever, he could very plausibly know a guy who has a ware-\nhouse full of such goodies.\n\nGenerally, every character contact starts the game with a\nLevel 1, a Level 2 and a Level 3 contact, Fixers and Mr. Johnson\ncontacts are exceptions to this rule—because of the line of work\nthey pursue, these contacts know 2 other contacts at each level.\n\nGamemasters may adjust these numbers to fit their cam-\npaigns (see Special Contacts, p. 66), though giving non-fixer and\nnon-johnson primary contacts more than 3 secondary contacts\nmight make it too easy for player characters to acquire both\nequipment and information.

These modifiers\nrepresent a FOF's willingness to help a character—a FOF who's a\nmere acquaintance of a character's contact won't be as ready to\nhelp a relative stranger as will a contact’s good friend.\n\nLike all contacts, FOFs expect a little nuyen in exchange for\ntheir help. To calculate the fee a FOF expects, first determine the\nbasic contact fee (see p. 202, SRI), then multiply the basic fee by\nthe appropriate cost/time multiplier from the Friend of a Friend\nModifiers Table, Gamemasters may choose to increase the cost\nmodifier if the character has to go through multiple FOFs to get\nwhat he wants, At the gamemaster's discretion, a Level 3 FOF\nmay reduce or even waive his fee as a favor to the contact.\n\nThe cost/time multiplier is also used to calculate the time a\ncharacter must wait for a FOF to deliver information or goods (see\nWaiting for the Goods, p. 65). The Wrong Party modifiers are\nused when making Wrong Party Tests (see The Walls Have Ears,\np. 65).\n\nBilly Boy’s had a run of good luck lately and has\nsome nuyen in his pocket, so he decides to pick up a\nless-than-legal Ares Alpha Combatgun with the\noptional grenade launcher. Billy starts out by making\na standard Etiquette Test with Joe the bartender. The\ntest generates only | success, so Joe gives Billy an\nodd look and says he “might know someone.” (The\ngamemaster has decided that Joe's 3 secondary con-\ntacts are a Mafia foot soldier (Level 1), a decker\nwhom Joe's known for years (Level 2), and Joe's\nbrother (Level 3), who’s a bouncer at a swanky\ndowntown club.)\n\nBilly approaches Timmons, his Lone Star officer\ncontact. He uses the bonus dice for his Etiquette Test\nand generates 5 successes. Consequently, Timmons\nis more than willing to help Billy. He tells Billy he'd\nbe happy to introduce him to any of his own sec-\nondary contacts—a Renraku security officer (Level 1),\na former Lone Star employee who now operates his\nown private sec firm (Level 2), and a reformed fixer\nwho happens to have been Timmons’s first arrest\n(Level 3),\n\nTarget Number Cost/Time\n\n“Asking around”\n\nF A FRIEND MODIFIERS TABLE\n\nWrong Party\nModifier Multiplier Target Modifier\n+6 3 -2\n+4 2 -1\n+2 (see text)\n\n+2 (see text)\n\nBilly decides that Joe's mob foot-soldier friend\nand Timmons’s ex-fixer chum are his best bets.\n\nBilly first approaches Joe, who tells him to come\nback after midnight and he'll introduce him to Tony\nthe Snake. When Billy returns, Joe directs him to a\nprivate booth, where Tony's waiting. At this point,\nBilly Boy makes his Etiquette Test. The standard base\ntarget number receives a +6 modifier because Tony's\na Level | contact. The test fails, and Tony says he\ncan't help him.

Instead of a cash fee, though, Sioux wants a favor\nfrom Billy. She needs some runners to help with a hit\non & Humanis Policiub training camp, and she wants\nBilly to help. Billy Boy accepts the offer—he figures it'll\ngive him a chance to field test his new gun.\n\nIf Billy rejects Sioux’s offer, he must pay her a\nfee for her help, which the gamemaster calculates\naccording to the following formula.

Billy will\nhave to pay the cost of the gun, regardless of Sioux's\nfee. If appropriate, Billy can make a standard\nNegotiation Test to lower Sioux’s fee.\n\nWAITING FOR THE GOODS\n\nTo calculate the time a FOF needs to locate information or\nequipment for a character, the gamemaster rolls 2D6, then applies\nthe appropriate cost/time multiplier from the Friend of a Friend\nMultipliers Table to the result. The final result is the waiting peri-\nod in days.\n\nCharacters may reduce the waiting period by spending any\nnumber of their Etiquette Test successes or by paying the contact\nadditional money. For each success or for each additional 10 per-\ncent of the contact's fee the character chooses to pay, the period\nis reduced by | day.\n\nNote that this waiting period only reflects the time that a FOF\nneeds to track down the requested information and/or goods. The\ngamemaster should also apply all standard Availability rules.\n\nBilly Boy now knows his new Ares Alpha\nCombatgun /s on the way, and he wants to know\nhow long he'll have to wait. The gamemaster rolls\n2D6 and gets a result of 7. Because Sioux’s a Level 3\nFOF, the gamemaster determines her cost/time mul-\ntiplier. That means Billy may have to wait 7 days, or\nhe may get the gun immediately.\n\nSioux tells Billy Boy she can have the gun for him\nin a few hours if he agrees to hit the Humanis camp. If\nhe refuses to help with the hit, Sioux says she'll need\n7 days to locate and obtain the Ares Alpha.\n\nBilly can't help with the Humanis hit, but he\ndoesn't want to wait 7 days for his gun, either. He\ndecides to slip Sioux some extra nuyen to speed\nthings along. Ten percent of Sioux’s 800-nuyen fee is\n80 nuyen; Billy decides he can afford to pay some\nextra nuyen if it means getting his new toy faster, and\nso he pays Sioux an extra 400 nuyen (80¥ x 50 per-\ncent) and cuts 5 days from the waiting period.\n\nTHE WALLS HAVE EARS\n\nAny time a character discusses biz with a contact or FOF—\nwhether it's a personal buddy or a FOF who agrees to meet the\ncharacter at the docks in the middle of a rainstorm at 4 a.m.—\nother parties may hear about the character's interest in informa-\ntion, equipment or any other commodity potentially worth nuyen.\nThese other parties—appropriately designated “wrong parties\"—\ncan be any individuals, groups or organizations that might feel\nthreatened by the character's inquiries, have an interest in grab-\nbing a piece of the character's action, or simply dislike the char-\nacter enough to mess with his or her plans.\n\nTo reflect the chances of wrong parties learning of a character's\ninquiries, the gamemaster makes a Wrong Party Test every time a\ncharacter uses a contact or FOF. The number of dice for the test\n\nequals the number of individuals involved in the inquiry. For exam-\nple, if a character talks biz to one contact, the gamemaster uses 2D6\nfor the test. If the inquiry is made by an 8-man team speaking to a\ncontact who must enlist the help of another contact, the gamemas-\nter uses 10 dice. (The more people involved in an inquiry, the\ngreater the chance that someone, somewhere will slip up.)\n\nThe base target number for the Wrong Party Test is 6, but\ngamemasters may increase it for especially careful or paranoid\ncharacters, or decrease it for particularly careless characters.\n\nIf a Wrong Party Test generates successes, the gamemaster\ndetermines the consequences based on the suggestions provided\nin the Wrong Party Table (p. 66). All successes are cumulative—\nadd together the successes of all Wrong Party Tests made during\na single line of inquiry.\n\nWhen characters use FOFs, apply the appropriate Wrong\nParty modifier from the Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table (note\nthat these are negative modifiers—they reduce the target number,\nmaking it more likely that word will leak out). The number of dice\nfor the test equals the number of individuals involved in the\ninquiry—all characters, FOFs, and the contacts who introduced the\ncharacters and FOFs.\n\nIf a character asks a contact to “ask around” about a particu-\nlar subject (see p. 202. SRI), add the appropriate modifier from\nthe Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table.\n\nIndividual gamemasters determine the exact consequences\nof Wrong Party Test successes, based on the campaign, the nature\nof the character's inquiries, and the nature of the wrong party.\n\nFor example, Ares is accustomed to runners trying to steal its\nlatest weapons prototypes, so it might not act until a line of\ninquiry generates 10 or more Wrong Party Test successes. On the\nother hand, even 2 or 3 successes might prompt a paranoid para-\nmilitary policlub group to go code red.\n\nIf several successes are generated during first-stage inquiries,\na gamemaster may decide that the wrong party begins a disinfor-\nmation operation that sends the characters wrong or planted\ninformation via their contacts and FOFs.\n\nThe Ares Alpha Combatgun is a new, highly ille-\ngal weapon. In fact, only Ares possesses the gun.\nEven the manufacturer's corporate and military\nclients are waiting for it.\n\nConsequently, Billy Boy's attempts to obtain a\nCombatgun are potentially a sensitive matter, so the\ngamemaster makes Wrong Party Tests to determine\nif Ares takes notice and action.\n\nBilly's first level of inquiries consists of his meet-\nings with Joe the bartender and Timmons the cop. For\neach of these meetings, the gamemasters uses 2D6\nto make a Wrong Party (6) Test. The test for the meet\nwith Joe generates no successes. The test for\nTimmons yields | success.

Your\ncompetition, your enemies and every potential target has a theory about your biz, but no one knows the\nparticulars of the assignment. If you work fast, you can keep ahead of the game.\n\nIt was inevitable—only under the rarest circumstances can you plan, execute, and get paid for a job with-\nout some outside party somehow jeopardizing the run, Your competition is workin’ the other side of the\nstreet; your enemies now know enough to figure out how to screw it up for you in the most dramatic way;\nyour target is 99 percent confident that you're coming for them.

Consequently, Ares doesn't\neven note his inquiry.\n\nBilly’ second level of inquiries consists of his\nmeetings with Tony the Snake and Sexy Sioux. For\nthe meeting with Tony, the gamemaster rolls 3D6 (1\ndie for Billy, 1 for Tony and 1 for Joe the bartender).\nTony is a Level 2 FOF. so the base Target Number 6\nreceives a —2 Wrong Party Modifier, as noted on the\nFriend of a Friend Modifiers Table.\n\nFor the meeting with Sioux, the gamemaster\nagain uses 3D6 (1 die for Billy, 1 for Sioux and 1 for\nTimmons the cop). The test receives no wrong party\nmodifier (Sioux is a Level 3 FOF), so the Target\nNumber is 6.\n\nThe test for the meet with Tony generates I suc-\ncess; the test for the meet with Sioux also generates\n1. That produces a total of 3 successes for both lev-\nels of inquiry. That's still a relatively low level of suc-\ncesses, and Ares Is a big corporation, so the\ngamemaster decides that Ares still takes no notice of\nBilly Boy's inquiries.\n\nSPECIAL CONTACTS\n\nSpecial contacts provide characters with access to greater\nresources than standard contacts. Special contacts fall into four\ncategories: members of clubs and organizations, fixers, interna-\ntional contacts and Shadowland.\n\nMEMBERS OF CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS\n\nBy acquiring a contact who is a member of a club or organi-\nzation such as the Humanis Policlub, Ork Rights Committee or\nother metahuman-rights groups, a character can gain FOFs who\nmay be able to provide inside information about the group's\nactivities or members.\n\nNearly any contact can be a member of a club or organization.\nClubs and organizations that espouse causes with broad appeal\nare especially likely to include a wide range of members. Wide\nappeal, however, also means that the chances of a contact know-\ning anyone in the group privy to the real secrets are slim.\n\nTo determine the number of group members a character must\nwade through to get inside information, the gamemaster rolls 2D6\nand divides the result by 2 (rounding up). The final result equals the\nnumber of people the character must talk to before reaching a\nknowledgeable FOF. Consider each FOF to be a contact of the pre-\nvious FOF, and apply all appropriate cost/time multipliers and\nwrong party modifiers from the Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table.\n\nFIXERS\n\nThe fixer is a combination pawn shop, Hollywood agent,\npolitician, arms dealer, drug smuggler, underworld crime boss,\ncon man, used-car salesman, and, in rare cases, normal person, all\nrolled into one. The fixer knows a wide range of individuals of\ndiverse talents, and he makes his money using these contacts to\nsupply a client with whatever the client needs or wants—for a fee,\nof course. To reflect this, all fixers possess 6 secondary contacts,\nusually including another fixer and, occasionally, a Mr. Johnson.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

A specialist fixer's secondary contacts\nshould reflect his specialty. For example a magical middleman\nmight know a talismonger, a former wage mage, a magical\nresearch specialist at Aztechnology, a member of the Illuminates\nof the New Dawn, a street shaman and so on. (Gamemasters\nshould determine the fields of specialized fixers based on their\ncampaign needs.)\n\nBasically, fixers earn their livelihoods by “doing favors” for\nclients.

Characters must remember, however, that nothing\nin Shadowland is private. Unlike metahuman contacts, who may\nagree to keep a secret and then actually keep their word, once a\npiece of information appears on Shacowland, it instantly becomes\navailable for public access. A character can hide the plans for a rev-\nolutionary new laser technology in Shadowland, but anyone else\nwho finds it can take it. Shadowland Is strictly an “all or nothing”\nproposition.\n\nAny character with Computer | or higher may select\nShadowland as a contact during character creation.

The person who created\neach icon determines the appearance of each file—ranging from\nthe frighteningly realistic Dunkelzahn icon that represents his last\nwill and testament to the “standard” default Matrix icon of a doc-\nument stolen from Ares.\n\nCharacters must know the right codes and pass several ID\nchecks in order to gain access to Shadowland and to the desired\ninformation, Like all contacts, Shadowland protects itself with a\nwell-established security screen. Rather than relying on systems\ncreated and manufactured by outside sources, however,\nShadowland relies on the skills and talents of some of the best liv-\ning deckers and programmers to manage its security. As a con-\ncession to the users’ safety, characters are identified only by their\nstreet name and decker icons—which do not indicate the location\nof the character's meat body or the motivation of his data search.\n\nAny information search in Shadowland takes 3D6 days to\nperform from a tortoise deck. This period reflects the time\nrequired to go through the millions of datapulses to find what the\ncharacter is looking for. Gamemasters may reduce or increase the\ntime required depending on the specifics of the search. For exam-\nple, a search for all available information on Damien Knight might\ntake several days, while compiling all the information available on\na tattooed razorpunk by the name of Zaz may require only a few\nminutes. When each search is completed, Shadowland compiles\nthe requested data in a folder known as a sourcebook.\n\nCharacters who visit Shadowland directly via the Matrix\n(rather than by using a tortoise) can initiate and complete a search\nin 2D6 hours.\n\nShadowiland also allows characters to use their own search\nknowbots, as long as those programs are approved by and regis-\ntered with the Shadowland deckers and programmers—a process\nthat usually takes less than an hour. Knowbot searches take 2D6\nhours. After completing its initial task, a registered knowbot can\nremain in the Shadowland matrix and feed its controlling charac-\nter any new information on the selected topic as soon as the infor-\nmation becomes available.\n\nIf desired, gamemasters can increase the difficulty of finding\nspecific information in Shadowland by applying an appropriate\ntarget number from the Contact Knowledge Table (p. 69) to all\nMatrix-based tests made to locate data. Gamemasters may also\nincrease the search period for characters using tortoises simply by\nadding the target number to the number of days required for the\nsearch. (This time increase reflects the painstaking effort required\nto access each and every document potentially related to the\ntopic in question.)\n\nPLAYING CONTACTS\n\nThe preceding rules are designed to make playing contacts as\nmuch fun for gamemasters as playing characters is for players. But\neven these rules, including the example of Billy Boy and his use of\ncontacts and FOFs, only scratch the surface of the possibilities such\nNPCs represent.\n\nGamemasters can make their contacts fully realized charac-\nters by generating biographies and game statistics as complete as\nthose of player characters (using any of the various character-cre-\n\nation systems, including Edges and Flaws where applicable).\nWhen contacts and their contacts become more well-rounded\npeople, gamemasters can find multiple uses for these characters:\nas instructors, Enemies (see p. 71), competitors, dupes, moles,\ntraitors, secret agents, godparents—and any of these roles can\nprovide the starting point for an adventure or a campaign.\n\nAs a twist on the usual role of contacts in a game, some con-\ntacts may seek out the player characters in search of information\n(game mechanics for these occurrences are provided in Favor for\na Friend, below). In some circumstances, contacts may compete\nwith player characters to obtain data or resources, a situation that\ncan quickly develop into bidding and information wars as contacts\nplay the characters off other NPCs or manipulate events to their\nown advantage. Other contacts may be pressured by outside indi-\nviduals, groups or other mysterious forces to not cooperate with\nplayer characters or even mislead them. Contacts also may be less\nthan cooperative for their own reasons (game mechanics for such\ncircumstances appear in Spilling the Beans, p. 69).\n\nStill other contacts can serve as ordinary “men on the\nstreet\"—sources of rumors, misinformation and apparently use-\nless information. A casual contact who tells the runners what they\nwant to know and then goes on to chat about recent weird hap-\npenings, an obscure news item, a disturbing, recurring dream, a\nproblem his wife is having at work or a general decline in the qual-\nity of the soyshakes at his local Stuffer Shack provides an excel-\nlent method of introducing clues about future events into the\ncampaign world without restricting the player characters’ desire\nto control their own destinies.\n\nFinally, by providing contacts with specialized knowledge.\nsecret histories, unexpected acquaintances or avenues of infor-\nmation that player characters might never suspect, gamemasters\ncan make contacts surprisingly multi-dimensional or disappoint-\ningly narrow in their knowledge, according to the demands of his\ngame. Asking a talismonger to obtain a gun may be a useless\nrequest, but asking your Thursday-afternoon chess partner at the\nlocal soykaf shop for the home address of a high-ranking Knight\nErrant official might lead to a big and unexpected payoff. (Game\nmechanics for such circumstances appear in Contact Knowledge,\nPp. 69).\n\nFAVOR FOR A FRIEND\n\nNearly every Shadowrun novel and most of the published\nadventures contain at least one instance in which someone asks a\nrunner to perform a “favor for a friend.”\n\nThe favor-for-a-friend job transcends the usual “work for\nnuyen” shadowruns and allows gamemasters to inject unexpect-\ned plot twists or introduce new levels of conflict into their cam-\npaigns. Favors requested by contacts also allow player characters\nto choose their own runs, rather than passively waiting for the\nnext Mr. Johnson to come along and offer them a job. Pursuing a\nshadowrun as a favor to a contact or friend allows runners to\nexplore personal interests and, more importantly, allows charac-\nters to take on opponents and obstacles with the confidence that\nthe job Is not planned as a setup—though it may well become a\ntrap somewhere along the way. Gamemasters also can tie favor\nrequests to the Markers system for Karma (see Karma, p. 76).\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

Will you be the lucky recipient of my\ncertified credstick, or should I go to one of my\nother contacts?”\n\n“What does the phrase ‘techno-magical elf cabal’ bring to\nmind in reference to our late, lamented president?”\n\nstay on the character's good side by telling him something, to\nthrow the character off the track, because he believes that his\ninformation is true, as a favor to one of his friends, to save his skin\nfrom his own enemies—the list of reasons goes on forever.\n\nOur friend Billy Boy has dropped in at Droogies to\nsee if Joe the bartender knows what's up with a certain\nmegacorp named Renraku. Billy specifically wants to\nfind out where Renraku is testing its latest cyberdeck\nprototype and who's in charge of those trials.\n\nThe gamemaster decides that this information\nqualifies as fairly sensitive, and so he decides that Joe\nwill know only part of what's being sald on the\nstreets. He then makes an Etiquette (Street) Test\nagainst a Target Number 8 to determine Joe's level of\nknowledge regarding the new deck.\n\nThe test generates no successes. Consequently,\nthe only news Joe has heard is that Renraku recently\nbeefed up security at a few of its local warehouses.\n\nSPILLING THE BEANS\n\nAs stated earlier, what a contact knows and what he or she is\nwilling to tell are two very different things. In most Shadowrun\ngames, gamemasters and players assume that contacts will reveal\nany information they know without argument. This section offers\nrules that more realistically reflect the facts of life: even contacts\nhave good days and bad days, personal crises and expensive\nhabits to support, and on any given day they may give away their\nsecrets for free or decide to keep their information to them-\nselves—or even worse, to sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "Enemies\n\nThe simplest way to simulate this interaction between char\n\nacter and contact is to modify the target number for the standard\nEtiquette Test that a character makes to obtain information from a\ncontact. Under the standard Shadowrun rules, the default target\nnumber for this test is 4. This number can change, depending on\nthe subject of the character's question. For example, a metahu-\nman-rights activist contact may be quite ready to spill the beans\non the local Humanis chapter, but the same contact might be\nquite reluctant to answer questions about the local Mob boss\nespecially if the mafioso is particularly powerful in the shaciows or\nif the contact has some sort of professional or personal relation\nship with the Mafia. in this case, getting information about the HP\nfrom Mongo the metahuman-rights activist may require only a\nsuccessful Etiquette (4) Test. Retrieving any information regarding\nthe local Mob from Mongo the Mafia soldier might require a suc-\ncessful Etiquette (12) Test—a much more difficult task, even\nthough the character is asking the same contact both questions.\nWhen making the Etiquette Test to determine the contact’s\nwillingness to talk, the gamemaster can also use the number of\nsuccesses from the test to determine how much information the\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion\n\n|\n\ncontact reveals. The greater the number of successes, the more\n\nthe contact tells. (This is the system used in all\n\nShadowrun adventures.)\nAlternatively\n\npublished\n\ngamemasters can make all Etiquette and\nNegotiation Tests opposed tests. In this case, the player character\nmakes his test per standard rules. The gamemaster makes the\nopposed test for the contact, applying any appropriate target\nmodifiers from the Contact Opposed Test Table (p. 71). The target\nnumber for the contact tests is the Charisma of the player charac-\n\nter. Subtract the total number of successes generated by the con\n\ntact’s Etiquette or Negotiation Test from the total successes gen\nerated on the player character's Etiquette Test. The result deter-\nmines how much information the contact reveals: the greater the\nnumber of successes, the more the contact tells.\n\nif the contact’s test generates more successes than the play\ner character's test, the gamemaster may decide that the contact\nsimply refuses to tell the character much of anything. or the con-\ntact might spin tall tales or give misleading Information\n\nNote that the modifiers in the Contact Opposed Test Table\ncan be used for opposed tests made during bargaining, interro-\ngation, or any other negotiation situation."

First, the gamemaster makes an\nEtiquette Test for Timmons to determine if\nthe cop knows anything about the new\nRenraku deck prototype. The gamemaster\nsets the Target Number at 8 (Renraku would\nunderstandably keep security tight around\nthe project). The test generates 2 successes,\nand so the gamemaster decides that\nTimmons knows who's running the proto-\ntype testing. and where the testing lab is\nlocated. (If pressed, the gamemaster will\nexplain that Timmons knows this info\nbecause Renraku hired Lone Star to provide\nsome extra patrols around the lab site and to\ncontrol after-hours access to it.)\n\nNext, Billy Boy makes the standard\nEtiquette Test to get Timmons talking. The\ninformation is sensitive, so the gamemaster\nsets the Target Number at 8. Billy receives an\nextra die on the test, because Timmons is 4\nLevel 2 contact, but Billy's test still only gen-\nerates 2 successes.\n\nNext, the gamemaster makes an\nopposed test for Timmons to determine\nwhat he tells Billy.

Remember that cer-\ntain character Flaws increase the number of or\nratings for a character's Enemies (see Edges and\nFlaws, p. 21.\n\nThough the Enemy Rating Table includes\nRatings 5 and 6 Enemies, these types of oppo-\nnents are probably best reserved for over-the-\n\ntop supervillain games. A high-Rating Enemy's\nefforts to catch or kill a character can easily\nbecome the major theme of a campaign—and\nsuch campaigns can quickly become tiresome\nfor other players if the gamemaster cannot find\na way to keep their characters involved in the\ngame. In most cases, no single character should\nstart a game with a Rating 5 or 6 Enemy,\nthough the Hunted Flaw (see p. 33) might jus-\ntify such a circumstance.\n\nUh-oh—those gangers just got some new toys from their\n\ncorp buddies.\n\nHow flattering—your chummers at Aztechnology hav\nhired some bounty hunters to deal with you.\n\nENEMY CHARACTERISTICS\nEvery Enemy is defined by three character-\nistics: Power, Motivation and Knowledge.

In short, the very nature of a shadowrunner's exis-\ntence guarantees that the character will always have an Enemy or\ntwo or three plotting against him or her, ever alert for the chance\nto get a little payback.\n\nTo create an Enemy or Enemies for a player character, the\ngamemaster first determines the character's Enemy Rating,\naccording to the Enemy Rating Table. The more powerful and\ninfluential a character is, the more trouble he will attract, and so a\ncharacter's resources provide a convenient basis for the Enemy\nRating. Characters with low Resources will have Enemies\ndesigned using a relatively low Enemy Rating; characters with\nhigh Resources will have Enemies designed using a relatively high\nEnemy Rating. The Enemies You Deserve table suggests rough\nguidelines for the type of Enemy each Enemy Rating represents.\n\nassign to the characteristics. The gamemaster\nassigns each characteristic a Rating of 0-6, bas-\ning the number of points on the type of Enemy\nbeing created, the demands of the campaign,\nthe character's actions and the complexity of\nthe gamemaster's (and/or player's) plan for the\nplayer character's ultimate fate. (The Characteristic Points can also\nbe thought of as “drek points,” because they represent how much\ndrek the Enemy can throw at the character.) Depending on how\nthe gamemaster weights the Enemy characteristics, that Enemy\nmay be a persistent annoyance or a constant threat, or every\nattack may seem arbitrary—the character simply doesn't see a\nconnection, and trouble from the Enemy always comes as a com-\nplete surprise. An Enemy makes an ideal plot device for sending\noff a character with the Borrowed Time Flaw (p. 25) in a blaze of\nglory (and helping out the team in the process).\n\nPower\n\nAn Enemy's Power rating indicates the resources the Enemy\ncan use to harass the character. For example, an Enemy with a low\nPower Rating (1 to 2 points), such as a corporate secretary, can't\nperform a hit herself. To harass a character, a corporate secretary\nwill have to come up with a low-tech, easy way to hurt a charac-\nter—like tipping off the cops. An Enemy with a moderate Power\nRating (3 to 4 points) might be able to geek the character himself,\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion"

However, such Enemies can spread nasty rumors very\neffectively and bide their time.\n\nMotivation\n\nAn Enemy's Motivation Rating indicates how badly the\nEnemy wants to hurt the character. An Enemy with low\nMotivation (1 to 2 points) might simply want to “teach that punk\na lesson” and will settle for smacking the character around or\nstealing his possessions. An Enemy with moderate Motivation (3\nto 4 points) will want to beat the character to within a centimeter\nof his life or “do back what he did to me.” An Enemy with high\nMotivation (5 to 6 points) will continent-hop and go into low-\nEarth orbit to track down the character and exact revenge.\n\nAn Enemy with Motivation 0 may wait for the character to fall\n\ninto her lap—which can be arranged, with cruel gammemaster plotting.\n\nKnowledge\n\nAn Enemy's Knowledge Rating indicates how much the\nEnemy knows about the character's whereabouts.

When he informed his daughter that she\nwas to marry an elderly, ailing rival businessman,\nJude's faith in her father’s judgment was completely\ndestroyed. Trained as an information specialist (busi-\nness jargon for “decker”) Jude found it easy to steal\nproprietary data from both her father's and her\nfiancé’s businesses. She then sold that data, bought\nherself a cyberdeck and took off for Denver.\n\nThe gamemaster decides that Jude has 3\nEnemies—her ex-fiancé, her father and the head of\nher father's security team, whom she used to get to\nthe information and then hung out to dry.\n\nKelly set Jude's Resources Priority Level at A\nduring character creation, so that means Jude has an\nEnemy Rating of 4. The gamemaster divides the\nEnemy Rating as follows:\n\nFather\nRating |\n\nPower: 0\n\nMotivation: 3\n\nKnowledge: |\n\nDaddy is moderately angry with Jude. He has a\nrough idea where she might have run, but lacks the\npower to find her or bring her back.\n\nEx-Fiancé\nRating !\n\nPower: |\n\nMotivation: 3\n\nKnowledge: O\n\nJude's ex-fiancé is moderately miffed at her sud-\nden departure.

He has the power to track her down, and he has\na rough idea of where she is.\n\nJude's troubles really begin if her Enemies\ndecide to cooperate—and in this situation, they\nmight easily do just that.\n\nUSING ENEMIES\n\nOnce the gamemaster establishes an Enemy for a character,\nthat Enemy can become more and less influential throughout the\ncourse of the campaign. The Enemy's initial rating may increase or\ndecrease depending on the character's actions, the campaign's\nstory line, events elsewhere in the universe—or, to be honest,\ngamemaster whim. Used judiciously, an Enemy can spice up a\ncampaign, derail a carefully laid plan, launch a shadowrun, add a\nmuch-needed or disastrously ill-timed complication (depending\non your point of view), or even distract a character by not show-\ning up when expected. Gamemasters choose when, how and why\nan Enemy surfaces and may raise or lower the Enemy's ratings and\nCharacteristic Points according to the current threat the Enemy\nposes. The gamemaster can also simply adjust the Enemy's\nactions to suit the story's needs, without crunching the numbers.\n\nManaging multiple Enemies for multiple characters can\nbecome tricky, but if gamemasters can find a way to successfully\ntrack all the Enemies of a shadowrunning team, the rewards in\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPeantion"

People turn\ninto Enemies for both more and less serious reasons than these,\nand each of the reasons provided here has many variations. Be\ncreative—imagine the player character's surprise when he discov-\ners that the mysterious force that has been messing with his cred\nrating for the past two years and causing him no end of headaches\nand embarrassment is none other than his former accountant,\nwhom the character only left because his sister married a CPA.\n\n+ You left her for dead, or something close to it.\n\n* You ruined his career/business/art, and he has nothing left to\nlose by hunting you down.\n\n* You burned/blackmailed/double-crossed/set her up—was it for\nyour profit or for her own good?\n\n* You're a (INSERT CHARACTER’S METATYPE/ETHNICITY/POLITI-\nCAL AFFILIATION/RELIGION HERE), and he's gonna put you in\nyour place,\n\n+ She’s been competing with you since childhood, Now it's serious.\n\n* His job or sense of honor requires him to hunt you down.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPepanion\n\n* You and she used to be friends, teammates or lovers. She never\nforgave you when you left.\n\n* He's just plain mean and petty, and you're a convenient target.\n\n+ Stuff as dangerous as what you've gotten hold of can't be\nallowed to fall into the wrong hands.\n\n* For some reason he thinks you're the baddest mage/\nsamurai/decker/detective on the streets, and he has to knock\nyou off to prove that he's the best.\n\n* You killed someone she cared about—a friend, spouse, lover,\nteacher or relative—or someone who was useful to them, such\nas a researcher, informant or contact.\n\n* They want to “make an example” of you.\n\n* They hate what you represent—your cause, your person, whatever.\n\n* You exposed his underhanded dealings to his superiors—or\nmaybe to the law.\n\n* You have something she needs for career advancement.\n\n+ You ruined or delayed their master plan with your deliberate or\nunknowing actions.\n\n+ You're on opposite sides of the law—but now it's getting personal.\n\n* She's jealous of what you can do or the way you live.\n\n* You know that nifty deck/cyberarm/focus you got last month? It\nonce belonged to him or someone he cared about.\n\n+ You just uncovered their conspiracy, and they have to silence you.\n\n* She just doesn’t like shadowrunners.\n\nDEATH AT THE ENEMY’S HAND\n\nThe primary purpose of Enemies in a Shadowrun campaign\nis to keep the characters on their toes—and nothing keeps a per-\nson on his toes more effectively than the constant threat of immi-\nnent death. At times, Enemies may devote all their time, energy\nand resources toward getting rid of a character or team or,\ndepending on the other distractions occupying their attention,\nEnemies may limit their efforts toward eliminating a character or\nteam to passive surveillance. Regardless of the Enemy's current\nlevel of interest in a character or team, the gamemaster can\nalways find ways to remind the character or team that the Enemy\nstill exists, still knows where they are, and still intends to take care\nof them as soon as it's convenient. An Enemy is always a threat,\neven if the character or team is not his or her current target.\n\nAfter all the build-up of an Enemy hunting down a character\nor team throughout a series of adventures or campaigns, with\neach event bringing the character or team a little closer to death,\nif the Enemy is going to succeed in his goal the final denouement\nmust be dramatic and meaningful.

If, however, players are particularly attached to\ntheir characters—as well they might be, considering the amount\nof time and effort required to create and maintain them—the\ngamemaster should design a big death scene that will satisfy\neveryone's sense of fair play and serve as a major event in the\ncampaign. A character's death should mean something: his sacri-\nfice could keep the team alive; his death might provide the nec-\nessary breakthrough in a case to bring down the bad guy; her\nheroic action may change the course of someone else's life, and if\nthe character lingers long enough, she might be able to die with\n\n4"

Anyone who's read comic books or seen\naction films will already know a handful of\nways to keep a character alive in the face of\nobviously superior Enemies and daunting\nodds. For example, characters may sur-\nvive explosions by sheltering behind or in\na convenient vehicle/steel crate/pile of\nbuilding materials/vault; escape from a\nsniper by being nursed back to health\nby a kindly stranger; overcome grievous\ninjury through cyber- or bioware\nreplacements; suddenly manifest\nmagical ability under pressure and\nwalk away from an attack com-\npletely unscathed (physically, at\nleast); and so on, Alternatively, the\ngamemaster can decide that a\ncharacter's Enemies have some\nfate other than death in store for\nthe character.

The\ndeath of an Enemy should have\nas much impact in the game as\nthe death of a character, and\ncan happen for as many differ-\nent reasons, An Enemy might\nalso survive a team’s efforts\nto kill him or her for the same\nreasons that a character escapes\ndeath. Killing an Enemy, however,\ndoes not guarantee that he or she is\ngone from a character's life. Player\ncharacters may learn the hard way that\nthere's more to living a carefree existence\n\nthan geeking all their Enemies.\n\nUsually, attempts to kill bad guys simply\nmake them madder. Shadowrun gamemasters\ncan use a wide variety of explanations to justify why an\nEnemy keeps coming back, even after the team thought he or she\nwas dead. Begin with the ever-popular, “Did you see/find the\nbody?” and move on to escapes based on magic, cyberware, or a\ncombination of any number of devices to explain the Enemy's\ncontinued existence.\n\nIf it serves the story for a character or team to actually suc-\nceed in killing their Enemy, the conflict rarely ends there. Enemies\nare people too, and they will have friends, relatives, co-workers,\nhive-mates, mentors, protégés, contacts, bodyguards, employers\nand any number of other interested parties willing and able to\navenge their deaths—and to step into their shoes as a new,\nimproved, unknown Enemy.\n\nG SHADOWRUN ComPantion"

        "text": "ADUANCGD RULES\n\nhe Advanced Rules section provides new ways to look at existing rules. These rules\nexpand and modify the uses of Karma, offer suggestions for returning wonder and mys-\ntery to the use of magic, provide guidelines for designing appropriate opposition for play-\ner characters, suggest rules for maintaining the state-of-the-art in technology and magic,\npropose a variety of ways for characters to retire and offer several miscellaneous rules that\ntweak specific areas of the current rules system.\n\nKARMA\n\nThe Shadowrun game mechanic of Karma represents a character's accumulated expe-\nrience and actions, By investing time and energy into certain aspects of his or her person-\nal development or by performing good deeds, a character can earn Karma Points—a sort of cosmic\n“brownie points.” In turn, these Karma Points improve the character's abilities and options. (See pp.\n190-91, SRI, for further information.)\n\nAWARDING KARMA: A CLARIFICATION\n\nIn SRI, players are instructed to distribute their characters’ Karma using the following guide-\nlines: “Of the Karma a character gets, 90 percent of it becomes Good Karma, which Is used over\nthe long term for improving the character. Ten percent goes into the character's Karma Pool for\nshort-term butt-saving. A character's Good Karma and Karma Pool are tracked separately. Always\nround off in favor of Good Karma.”\n\nIn simpler terms, a character who receives 10 points of Good Karma adds the next Good\nKarma Point he earns to his Karma Pool. Then the cycle begins again. The next 10 points go to Good\nKarma, followed by a point to his Karma Pool, and so on."

        "text": "BALANCING KARMA AND NUYEN\n\nMost experienced Shadowrun gamemasters have faced the\nproblem of balancing the amount of Karma and nuyen that player\ncharacters earn during a campaign.\n\nThe problem of too much or too little nuyen or Karma arises\nbecause different player characters may have radically different\nneeds. On one hand, characters reliant on technology need nuyen\nto maintain their cyberdecks and implants and to buy all the latest\ntech toys. On the other hand, using magic generally requires large\namounts of Karma, and characters who use magic often become\n“Karma vacuums,” never having enough Karma to accomplish\nwhat they want to do. A few characters hover in the middie,\nrequiring both Karma and nuyen to remain effective in their role\non the team. Consequently, the gamemaster must carefully dis-\npense cash and Karma so that players have enough for their needs\nbut not enough to unbalance the campaign.\n\nThough gamemasters can easily take excess money away\nfrom characters, keeping Karma under control can be a bit tricki-\ner, The Karma-for-Cash and Cash-for-Karma exchanges provide\noptions for managing Karma assets.\n\nKarma for Cash\n\nUnder the Karma-for-Cash exchange rule, the gamemaster\nprovides opportunities for player characters to cash in Good\nKarma Points for nuyen or equivalent resources.\n\nSuch opportunities represent “lucky breaks” that come a\ncharacter's way—someone paying off an old favor, a sudden\nwindfall, an easy score, winning the lottery and so on.\n\nGamemasters should determine the amount of\nmoney/resources a character receives in exchange for Karma\nbased on the average levels of nuyen characters possess in the\ncampaign. For example, characters in a relatively down-scale\ncampaign might receive 100 nuyen for each Good Karma Point\nthey cash in. In a more upscale campaign, a single Good Karma\nPoint might be worth 1,000 nuyen. For random, infrequent wind-\nfalls, gamemasters can roll dice to determine how much money a\ncharacter receives. For example, a gamemaster might determine\nthe amount of a windfall by rolling 2D6 and multiplying the result\nby 10.\n\nIn any case, Karma Points that are cashed in for nuyen or\nother assets are permanently gone, in the same way as if the char-\nacter had spent the points to buy a new skill,\n\nAdditionally, individual gamemasters should set their own\nlimits on how frequently characters can cash in Karma and how\nmuch Karma they can exchange at any one time. Because the\nworkings of Luck and Fate are unpredictable and mysterious, feel\nfree to alter these limits throughout the course of the campaign,\nor set new limits for each exchange.\n\nCash for Karma\n\nIn the Cash-for-Karma option, a character may exchange\nnuyen for Karma Points.\n\nSuch exchanges may represent a character giving money to\na church or charity, gambling it away in honor of Lady Luck (per-\nfect for a Coyote shaman), spending it on a “magical lifestyle” that\n\nenables the character to perform daily devotions and rituals to\nboost her Karma, and so on.\n\nIndividual gamemasters should determine the “nuyen cost”\nof Karma Points in their campaigns. Low nuyen costs will enable\ncharacters to more easily purchase Karma and may encourage\nplayer characters to take up magic. Higher nuyen costs will have\nthe opposite effect.\n\nRegardless of the temptation, players should avoid bankrupt-\ning their characters just to gain a couple of extra Karma Points.\nHaving a lot of Karma does a character very little good when she\ncan’t pay her rent!\n\nKARMA AND THE AMORAL CAMPAIGN\n\nAs a race, we humans like to believe that the cosmos rewards\nconstructive and productive actions more readily than greedy or\ndestructive ones, As is clearly incicated in the rules for Karma and\nthe Karma awards suggested in every published adventure, the\nShadowrun rules reflect this belief by rewarding characters who\ndo good deeds and punishing those who fail to do the right thing.\nWhile history and fiction both provide numerous examples of\npeople who live and act outside the law behaving in a heroic fash-\nion, those same sources prove many times over that being bad\ncan be a whole lot of fun. Rich and powerful people don't worry\nabout the cosmos rewarding them; they have enough money and\ninfluence to create their own luck.\n\nBy definition, shadowrunners live outside the law. While that\ndoesn't automatically make them evil, it also doesn't automatical-\nly mean that they act like Robin Hood. For every group of shad-\nowrunners looking to make a difference in the world and change\nthings for the better, there is a shadowrunning team willing to do\nanything for nuyen. Neither approach is the only right choice,\nbecause in roleplaying the right choice is the one that lets the\ngroup have the most fun. Though the Shadowrun rules encourage\nthe heroic attitude, the Shadowrun universe seems custom-made\nfor skilled opportunists, both player-characters and NPCs.\n\nIn those Shadowrun games where the player characters (and\nmost NPCs) are amoral, if not downright immoral, gamemasters\nmay use a variation of the Cash-for-Karma exchange system to\nallow characters to purchase Karma. This arrangement enables\ncharacters to obtain Karma Points to use for character improve-\nment and growth without performing good deeds against their\nnature and inclinations. When using this system, the gamemaster\nmakes no standard Karma awards during the campaign: player\ncharacters must obtain all Karma by purchasing it. The gamemas-\nter sets any limits on the amount of Karma characters can pur-\nchase at any one time.\n\nThe player must first announce his intention to purchase\nKarma for his character, at which point the gamemaster deter-\nmines the cost using the following formula: 3D6 x 100 = nuyen\ncost of 1 Karma Point. Keeping the cost of Karma unpredictable\nprevents players from keeping a running calculation of how much\nKarma their character can afford at any given time, thereby more\nclosely matching the basically random system for receiving Karma\nunder the standard rules.\n\nPer the standard rules, a character must obtain 10 Good\nKarma Points before he can gain a Karma Pool Point.\n\nSHADOWRUN COMPANION"

        "text": "FAVORS AND MARKERS\n\nFavors and markers offer additional optional uses for Karma\nin Shadowrun. A favor represents the obligation of an NPC to per-\nform a service or action for a player character. A marker represents\nan obligation of a player character to perform a service or action\nfor an NPC. Favors provide a way for characters to spend Karma\nPoints. Markers let them earn Karma Points. Favors and markers\nmay be negotiated between characters and contacts, friends,\nneighbors, family, business associates or any other NPCs with\nwhom the character regularly comes into contact; favors and\nmarkers might just as easily be bargained for with strangers who\nhappen to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nFor | Good Karma Point, a player character can purchase a\nfavor from an NPC. For the purposes of the favor, the NPC acts like\na Level | contact (see Contact Levels, p. 62) and maintains a\nFriendly attitude toward the character for the purpose of Social\nSkill Tests (p.180, SRII), If desired, gamemasters may give player\ncharacters the option to substitute favors for Karma awards at the\nend of adventures. This practice enables characters to store up a\nfew favors that they can collect on when necessary.\n\nWhen an NPC (never another player character) calls in a mark-\ner, the player character must perform the requested service or\naction, If the player character performs the requested service, she\nreceives at least | Karma Point. Gamemasters may increase the\nKarma Points earned if performing the service is especially diffi-\ncult for the character.\n\nOnly players can agree to markers for their characters, though\ngamemasters may encourage the use of favors and markers by\nhaving NPCs negotiate for markers when dealing with characters\n(“l'll do this for you and you can owe me one.”), Characters can\nalso trade a marker for a future favor from an NPC.\n\nKARMA POOLS\n\nA character's Karma Poo! reflects a character's accumulated\n“luck.” Generally, Karma Pool Points give more experienced char-\nacters an advantage over less experienced characters with the\nsame levels of ability, lending support to the maxim, “age and\ntreachery will beat youth and skill every time.”\n\nThe following rules enable gamemasters to expand the use of\nand more closely control Karma Pools in their games. The\ngamemaster and all players in a group should agree on any vari-\nant Karma Pool uses before incorporating them into their game.\n\nLimiting Karma Pools\n\nIn some cases, player characters may amass huge Karma Pools\nthat enable them to escape dangerous situations with little effort. By\nlimiting Karma Pools in their games, gamemasters can force charac-\nters to reduce their reliance on Karma Pools to escape harm.\n\nReducing the rate at which characters earn Karma Pool Points\nis the simplest way to do this. Under the standard rules, charac-\nters must earn 10 Good Karma Points before earning a Karma\nPool Point (see Awarding Karma: A Clarification, p. 76).\nReducing this rate, so that characters must earn 20 Karma Points\nbefore they can earn a Karma Pool Point, will keep characters’\nKarma Pools smaller and make it easier for the gamemaster to\nmaintain game balance.\n\nGamemasters may also use a staggered-rate system for\nincreasing Karma Pools. Under this system, a character earns\nKarma Poo! Points at the standard rate until the Karma Pool reach-\nes 5. From 6 to 10, the character earns | Karma Pool Point for\nevery 20 Good Karma Points. When the Karma Pool reaches 10\npoints, the character then earns | Karma Pool Point for every 30\nGood Karma Points. The staggered-rate system makes acquiring\nvery high Karma Pools extremely difficult and tends to even the\nplaying field between more and less experienced characters.\n\nSplit Karma Pools\n\nSplit Karma Pools, or subpools, provide another means of\nreducing a character's reliance on a single, massive Karma Pool,\nThis option also provides players with additional opportunities to\n“customize” their characters by creating strengths and weakness-\nes according to the type of Karma Pools designed and the alloca-\ntion of Karma Points to each pool, and slows down Karma Pool\nadvancement by forcing players to divide all Karma earned\nbetween multiple, potentially exclusive pools.\n\nUnder standard Karma Pool rules, a player character can use\nhis Karma Pool Points to purchase additional dice for nearly any\ntest. Under the Split Karma Pools system, the character must\ndivide his Karma Pool Points among several subpools, which then\nmay be used to purchase dice only for specific tests.\n\nFor example, in addition to the usual pools—Control,\nHacking, Magic and Combat—the gamemaster may incorporate\nthe Athletics, Social and Dodge pools described in Skills and\nTraining, p. 48. Depending on what strengths a player wants to\nemphasize for his character, he may also designate even more\nspecialized skill pools, such as Negotiation, Electronics or Biology.\nIf the gamemaster approves, characters may use dice from a sub-\npool to make a test for a related skill. For example, because the\nNegotiation skill is linked to the Leadership skill on the Skill Web,\nthe character could use the Negotiation Subpool dice to make a\nLeadership Skill Test. For such default-skill applications of Karma\ndice, subpool points are worth only half their normal value.\n\nThough a Build/Repair Subpool would have little impact on\ngame play, characters such as riggers, deckers and others who\nrely on such skills to maintain their edge on the streets might find\nsuch a pool extremely valuable.\n\nExtended Actions\n\nGamemasters may also allow player characters to use Karma\nPool Points when performing time-consuming actions such as\nwriting Matrix utilities, spell research, enchanting and other activ-\nities that require hours, days or even longer periods of time to\ncomplete.\n\nUnder this option, the character must allocate Karma Pool\nPoints to the skill test for the action when the extended activity\nbegins, even if the required skill test comes at the end of the task.\nIn addition, the Karma Pool does not refresh until the action is\ncompleted. For example, if a decker character spends 2 Karma\nPoints to add dice to a Computer Skill Test to write a program that\nrequires 3 days to complete, her Karma Pool does not refresh\nuntil she has finished writing the program.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "Permanent Karma Loss\n\nFinally, gamemasters can limit the size of characters’ Karma\nPools by increasing the number of Karma Pool uses that result in\npermanent Karma loss.\n\nUnder the standard rules, a player character loses any Karma\nPool Points he uses to buy test successes (see p. 191, SRI). These\npoints are not replaced when the Karma Pool refreshes—the char-\nacter must earn new Karma Points to replace them. Similarly,\ngamemasters can simply declare that other specific uses of Karma\nresult in the loss of Karma Points. The gamemaster and all players\nshould agree on any affected Karma uses before using this option\nin a game.\n\nHAND OF GOD\n\nThe Hand of God rule allows player characters to spend their\nentire store of Karma—both Good Karma and Karma Pool\nPoints—in a single instant.\n\nThe rule is designed for use when a character faces dire cir-\ncumstances and no single Karma Pool will save his hoop—ike\nwhen that high-powered sniper rifle goes off and the character is\nseeing that bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This use of\nKarma represents divine intervention—the Big Wheel of Fate\ndeciding that the character's time on this planet is not yet up and\nmiraculously pulling him from the very jaws of Death.\nGamemasters can explain this phenomena with any rationale they\nlike, from sheer coincidence to the intervention of gods, totems,\nloa and so on.\n\nTo use Hand of God, a character must possess at least 1\nKarma Poo! Point. When the character burns all her Karma at once\nto avoid certain death, these points are gone. The character has no\nKarma until she earns new Karma Points.\n\nUnderstandably, losing all of one’s Karma can be a traumatic\nevent for a character. To reflect this, the character must make a\nWillpower (6) Test. If the test fails, the character receives a mental\nFlaw, selected by the controlling player. After the player selects the\nFlaw, the gamemaster selects a mental Edge of equal or lesser value\n(see Edges and Flaws, p. 2!) for the character. The Flaw represents\nthe trauma of the experience, and the Edge represents the strength\nthe character gained from surviving the experience. The character\nretains the Flaw and Edge for the remainder of her life.\n\nA character may use the Hand of God only once.\n\nMAGIC\n\nIdeally, characters should view magic in the Shadowrun uni-\nverse as a mysterious, unpredictable force that exposes its users\nto great risk, as well as providing them with great power.\n\nHowever, as players have grown increasingly familiar with the\nmagic rules over the past few years, characters no longer fear magic’s\nrandom and unpredictable nature. In addition, some magician char-\nacters have amassed enormous powers that disrupt game balance\nand make the life of their teams much safer—and a lot less fun.\n\nThe rules in this section are designed to remedy these prob-\nlems by providing gamemasters with new ways to inject more\nunpredictability and danger into the use of magic, restrict the\npower of magician characters, and reduce the total amount of\nmagic in their games.\n\nThose players anxiously awaiting a dramatic, noticeable rise\nin the magic level of the universe should keep in mind that all\nShadowrun magic depends on the level of mana, a natural force\nthat rises and falls in a cycle that lasts thousands of years.\nCurrently, the universe's mana level is simply not high enough to\npower specialty magic items other than foci. Some day the mana\nlevel may rise high enough to power such items and make possi-\nble other unimaginable magical feats.\n\nOf course, mana is a mysterious and unknown force, so no\none can truly predict what course it will take. That said, various\nShadowrun books such as Threats, Harlequin’s Back and\nAwakenings contain subtle hints and clues about the ebb and flow\nof mana, and interested players will find continuing clues to com-\ning changes in future Shadowrun releases.\n\nINITIATION\n\nMagical initiation (see The Grimoire and Awakenings\nsourcebooks) provides magical characters with access to new abil-\nities and options such as metamagic, and gives them nearly\nunlimited potential to develop increasing amounts of power.\n\nThe following options provide gamemasters with ways to\ncontrol magical initiations in their games, and to make initiation\nmore accessible to characters who are not well-acquainted with\nthe complex rules of initiation and metamagic.\n\nRestricting Initiation\n\nIdeally, magical initiation represents a character's magical\neducation and slow accumulation of wisdom. All too often, how-\never, magician characters undergo initiation as soon as possible to\nreap the benefits it provides, In some campaigns, this may be\nacceptable and even desirable. Generally, however, a rash of\n“rampant initiations” can ruin the balance of a game.\n\nGamemasters can restrict initiations in several ways. Most\nsimply, gamemasters can prohibit player characters from using\nthe Force Points from their allocated Resources to create starting-\ncharacter initiates.\n\nAlternatively, the gamemaster can require that a teacher,\nspirit-helper or magical group of some kind assist during the first\nInitiation of any character. By controlling the availability of suitable\nteachers, the gamemaster can control initiations in his campaigns.\nAdditionally, the search for a suitable teacher can become an\nadventure goal and provide the character with a chance to earn\nsome extra Karma toward initiation. Players may prefer this sim-\nple initiation restriction because it preserves most of their choic-\nes—once the character has achieved Initiate Grade Rating 0, he is\nfree to self-initiate per standard rules.\n\nGamemasters can also limit initiations by requiring that char-\nacters undergo ordeals for all initiations or when attempting to\nreach specific Grace Ratings (see pp. 39-41, Grimoire and pp.\n113-14, Awakenings for ordeal rules). Ordeal requirements work\nespecially well with the gradual initiation system described below.\n\nGradual Initiation\n\nThe knowledge and abilities provided by initiation represent\na quantum leap in the development of a magician. Some\ngamemasters may prefer to change this vast leap into a series of\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPantion"

        "text": "short hops so that they can better control the abilities that a magi-\ncian gains as he is initiated. Additionally, this system reduces the\npower gap between initiates and non-initiates.\n\nUnder the gradual-initiation system, the magician does not\ngain access to all of the abilities of metamagic at once. Instead,\nthe character starts out with a basic “package” of initiate abilities\nat Grade 0. Then, as the initiate achieves each successive Grade,\nhe can learn one of the existing metamagical abilities. Thus, a\nmagician will not know all of the metamagical abilities until he\nreaches Grace 6.\n\nThe Grade 0 “basic package” consists of all the “astral abili-\nties” of initiation: an Astral Pool, a bonus to Astral Reaction and\nthe ability to travel to the metaplanes (characters with astral pro-\njection only), along with all of the abilities associated with per-\nforming Astral Quests (see p. 93, Grimoire). The magician might\nthen learn the metamagical abilities in the following order:\nMasking, Shielding. Centering, Dispelling. Quickening and\nAnchoring.\n\nIndividual gamemasters can set the order in which the char-\nacter learns the remaining metamagical abilities or simply allow\ncharacters to pick one ability per Grade. The order will have little\neffect on game balance, and different magical organizations are\nlikely to teach the abilities in different sequences. Furthermore,\nletting characters select the order in which they will learn metam-\nagic or setting different learning sequences for different characters\nwill foster greater variety among initiates.\n\nGamemasters can treat the additional metamagical abilities\ndescribed in Awakenings (pp. 99-100) as parts of their “parent”\nmetamagical skills or consider each additional ability separately\nfor the purposes of acquiring metamagic.\n\nThe gradual initiation system sharply limits the abilities of\nstarting initiates and reduces initiation to a valuable goal, rather\nthan an amazing, unmanageable leap in knowledge. The gradual\ninitiation system also increases the Karma costs of gaining new\nGrades, providing another option for controlling the amount of\nKarma in a game.\n\nUNPREDICTABLE HAZARDS OF MAGIC\n\nDespite research on the nature of magic, it remains a some-\ntimes fickle and unpredictable force in the twenty-first century.\nThough the various magical traditions possess techniques, rituals\nand spells that work well 99 percent of the time, no one truly\nunderstands how magic functions. Consequently, every now and\nthen attempts to use magic result in unexplainable events that\nrange from the humorous to the horrible—events that have given\nrise to numerous rumors of unlucky spelicasters being dragged\nscreaming into some netherworld by demons or suffering from\nmental breakdowns because they saw Something Man Was Not\nMeant to Know.\n\nOf course, the Shadowrun rulebook provides fairly compre-\nhensive and specific rules about how magic works. The detailed\nnature of the game rules sometimes creates the impression that\nthe inhabitants of the Sixth World also understand how magic\nworks. The following rules are designed to correct that impression\nand provide gamemasters with a few ideas for keeping magic a\nwild, mysterious, unpredictable and dangerous phenomenon in\ntheir games.\n\nMagical Misfires\n\nThe Rule of One (p. 32, SRI) is the simplest way to trigger\nmagical misfires. Whenever a magician’s Magical Skill Test yields\nall Is, his use of magic creates some strange and unpredictable\neffect. Most magicians, however, have so many dice to throw\naround on their Magical Tests that a result of all Is is exceedingly\nrare.\n\nTherefore, gamemasters may wish to employ the following\nRule of One variant (first introduced in Fields of Fire). Under the\nRule of One variant, a magical misfire occurs whenever the num-\nber of Is rolled on a Magical Test equals or exceeds the base Skill\nor Force Rating used for the test. Thus, a magician who uses sev-\neral bonus dice on a test increases the chance that his spell will\nmisfire, A magician using a high Skill Rating and a spell with a\nhigh Force Rating decreases his chances of a misfire.\n\nBubba the mage decides to throw a Force 4\nFireball at the go-ganger trying to run him down.\nBubba uses 6 dice from his Magic Pool on the test,\nwhich generates the following results: 10, 9, 7. 4, 4,\n3, 1, 1, 1, 1. Bubba's spell misfires and toasts him\nwhere he stands.\n\nWhenever a magical misfire occurs, the magical forces\nescape the magician's control and create an unpredictable effect.\nGamemasters are encouraged to be creative and cruel—don't kill\nthe character outright, but anything up to instant death is fair\ngame. In the case of Bubba's mis-cast fireball spell, the misfire\nmight set Bubba’s clothes on fire, blow up any gas tank within 20\nmeters, summon a Force 4 fire elemental under nobody's control,\nsurround the ganger in a temporary halo of fire or trigger any\nnumber of effects.\n\nAny use of magic may cause a misfire. Misfires caused by\nConjuring Tests tend to produce uncontrolled spirits, the wrong\ntype of spirit, multiple spirits and manifestations of greater or less-\ner power than the caster intended. Some conjuring misfires have\nsummoned hostile and dangerous spirits of a kind that no one has\never seen before. Enchanting Test misfires tend to create explo-\nsions, produce cursed or dangerous foci, trigger poltergeist phe-\nnomena and cause severe Drain on the spelicaster (treat as [Focus\nRating]D Drain that causes Mental damage). Sorcery Test misfires\nare the most common type and may trigger virtually any kind of\nmagical effect.\n\nUnlike normal failures under the Rule of One, magical misfires\ncannot be prevented by using a Karma Pool Point to re-roll a\nresult of 1. A magician can spend | point of Good Karma to\nreduce the misfire to a normal failure per the standard rules.\n\nVariable Mana and Astral Conditions\n\nLike the physical world, astral space is not a uniform place. It\ncontains “terrain” and astral conditions that vary widely from\nPlace to place and change with time. Some conditions may\nreduce the effects of magic, others may increase the effects of\nmagic, and still others may cause magic to consistently produce\nunpredictable effects.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "Background count is one condition that affects how\nmagic works in a specific location. Depending on the back-\nground count of an area, magic effects may be boosted or\nlowered. In some instances, the background count will\naffect only certain kinds of magic. (For further information\non background counts, see p. 103, Awakenings.)\n\nOther mana and astral conditions may vary according\nto time. Many magical traditions hold certain dates sacred.\nDuring these times, magical forces may become especially\npotent or weak—the background count or the rating of a\npower site or ley line may drop or rise dramatically. For\nexample, during Halloween the barriers between the astral\nand physical world grow thin. Consequently, magicians\nworking spells on Halloween night might find that nearly\nany place where people observe the holiday becomes a\npower site with a Rating of | or 2 (the exact rating is deter-\nmined by how strongly the local inhabitants uphold the\noriginal tradition), Typically, such effects are strongest in\nareas where local inhabitants still observe the sacred times,\nor where the dates have been observed for long periods of\nhistory. Specific events might also cause a temporary back-\nground count (see p. 104, Awakenings) that fades as time\npasses.\n\nGamemasters are encouraged to experiment with dif-\nferent magical conditions in different places and times\nthroughout their campaigns. Furthermore, magician char-\nacters may make Magic Theory and Astral Perception Tests\nto learn more about local conditions before working any\nmagic. Gamemasters set test target numbers, based on the\ncharacter's background and the local conditions.\n\nMana Surges\n\nMana surges are like “storms” in astral space. These\nviolent disturbances are rarer and infinitely more volatile\nthan place- or time-based mana and astral variations, and\nthey can cause the effects of magic to shift unpredictably. Mana\nsurges seem to occur under certain rare conditions such as astro-\nlogical conjunctions, but so far no one has created a reliable sys-\ntem for predicting the formations, locations or intensities of mana\nsurges.\n\nA mana surge may affect an area ranging in size from a sin-\ngle city block to an entire country. Surges can last anywhere from\na few minutes to a several weeks. No recorded mana surge has\never lasted longer than a lunar month (28 days). Individual\ngamemasters determine the affected areas and duration of mana\nsurges in their campaigns.\n\nDuring a surge, any magic cast in the area becomes difficult\nto control and results become unpredictable. In game terms, a\nsurge may affect magic in two basic ways: it may cause a change\nin a spell's Force Rating and/or Drain Level or a change in the\nForce Rating of a summoned spirit.\n\nSpell Casting Effects: The gamemaster can simply choose an\neffect appropriate to his campaign or the character doing the cast-\ning, select an effect from the Mana Surge Spell Effects Tabie, or\ndetermine the effect by rolling 1D6 and consulting the Mana\nSurge Spell Effects Table.\n\nMANA SURGE SPELL EFFECTS TABLE\n\nFirst 1D6 Roll Result\n1-2\n4\n5-6\n\nDie Roll Result\nlor6é\n=\n\n3\n4\n5\n\nFORCE INCREASE* TABLE\nDie Roll Result\nlor6\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n\nDRAIN CHANGE TABLE\nDie Roll Result\n1 or6\n2Zor3\n\nEffect\n\nRoll 1D6, consult Force Decrease Table\nRoll 1D6, consult Force Increase Table\nRoll 1D6, consult Drain Change Table\n\nEffect\n\nForce remains unchanged\nReduce Force by |\n\nReduce Force by 2\n\nReduce Force by 3\n\nReduce Force of spell by 1/2\n\nEffect\n\nForce remains unchanged\nIncrease Force by 1\nIncrease Force by 2\nIncrease Force by 3\nDouble Force\n\nEffect\nDrain remains the same\nDrain is staged up by 1 level\n\n4or5 Drain is staged down by | level\n\n*All standard penalties for casting a spell greater than the caster's\nMagic Rating apply (see p. 128, SRM).\n\nAll tests for the affected spell are made using the Force of the\nspell as dictated by the two die rolls, with a minimum Force of 1.\n\nKeep in mind that a change to the Force of a spell will also\naffect its Drain. If a spell’s Drain level is listed as Deadly and must\nbe staged up, add | to the target number for the Drain Resistance\nTest, regardless of the Force of the spell. Stage Drain down as nor-\nmal.\n\nA mana surge affects all spells cast in the physical or astral\nplane of the affected area, including spells cast for ritual magic.

        "text": "A spirit with a Force Rating higher than the summoner\nexpected will remain to perform the requested service, but the\ngamemaster should make the spirit as insubordinate and resent-\n\nful as possible.\n\nUnknown Magic\n\nMagic breaks the rules—that’s the one magic rule that\ngamemasters should always keep in mind. The standard\nShadowrun magic rules describe the magic that player characters\nare able to use and control—the fairly commonplace and well-\nunderstood aspects of the mystic arts, But there is far, far more to\nmagic than the people of the Sixth World have managed to learn.\n\nConsequently, sometimes magic acts in ways that nobody\ncan explain, not even the best theoreticians. This gives the\ngamemaster the freedom to introduce whatever wizzer new mag-\nical things he or she wants to add to his or her campaign—with-\nout having to explain their existence or the way they work to the\nplayers. If you want to create a unique magical item that lets your\nplayers turn a group of Aztec blood mages to stone under the\nlight of the full moon, that's cool. And if the players start to cele-\nbrate because they think they have a talisman they can use to turn\nall of their enemies to stone, gently remind them of the dangers\nof relying too heavily on unknown magical items before you let\nthem find out for themselves that the talisman only works against\nmagicians using blood magic under a full moon during the Hour\nof Mictlanteculti. In fact, that particular item might never work\nagain. Why? Because it's magic.\n\nBy the same token, if you want some NPC to have a spell, rit-\nual or magical item that is like nothing your player characters have\never seen, go right ahead. The Sixth World contains plenty of peo-\nple who have access to magic that others may not understand.\nSome of the magical groups and entities from the Threats source-\nbook, for example, have access to magic beyond most humans’\nken, and it is said that madness carries with it insights into things\nthat a sane person could never comprehend—so who knows what\npowers an insane magician might tap?\n\nIf your players have decided that they know everything there\nis to know about how magic works, throw something at them to\nremind them that magic is a mysterious, unpredictable force far\nbeyond their powers of comprehension.\n\nMAINTAINING THE MYSTERY OF MAGIC\n\nIdeally, magic should be a rare and unusual phenomenon in\nthe Shadowrun universe, and magically talented individuals\nshould be a rare breed—\"a mere | percent of the population,”\naccording to The Grimoire sourcebook, Yet in many Shadowrun\ngames, “sometimes it seems like you can’t swing a dead black cat\nwithout hitting a fraggin' magician,” as the twenty-first-century\nanthropologist Mullins Chadwick observes. As a result, magic\nthreatens to become anything but rare and unusual.\n\nFortunately, addressing this problem is fairly simple. First,\ngamemasters must understand that limiting the amount of magic\nin a campaign will make the magic that remains all the more\nimpressive and unusual. Second, gamemasters must exercise a\nlittle restraint and resist the urge to incorporate all of their favorite\nmagical phenomena into a single game session.\n\nThese solutions do not address the need to create magical\nchallenges to keep magical piayer characters occupied. Virtually\nevery shadowrunning group contains at least one magician char-\nacter, and the group's opponents will need to have some mojo to\ncounter that character. The following section provides a few\noptions that gamemasters can use to reduce the amount of magic\nthey must introduce into a campaign to maintain game balance.\n\nLimits\n\nLimiting the number of player-character magicians is proba-\nbly the simplest way to reduce magic use in a campaign. Limit\nshadowrunning teams to one magician each, and keep all magi-\ncally talented characters rare in most games.\n\nIf every player in a group wants to play a magician or adept,\nrun a specialized campaign specifically designed to challenge\ntheir abilities (see Double, Double Toil and Trouble, p. | 19).\n\nMagic Resistance\n\nWhenever possible and practical, use magic-resistant mun-\ndane opponents. The cybermantic characters described in the\nCybertechnology sourcebook are a good (but rare) example of\nsuch opponents. Rigger-controlled drones, security ‘bots, and\nguards hyped up on drugs to make them resistant to mana-type\nspells are other examples of potential magic-resistant mundane\n\nopponents.\n\nBackground Count\n\nMake careful use of background counts and aspected magic\nareas (see p. 103, Awakenings). It seems highly likely that certain\ncorps and powerful individuals purposefully cultivate high back-\nground counts in certain sites to deter magical opponents. The\nFAT bacteria mentioned in on page 82 of the Corporate Security\nsourcebook is one way corps might create such background\ncounts, but even the daily activities of most corps can easily cre-\nate low background counts.\n\nCritters\n\nAwakened critters are another excellent substitute for NPC\nmagicians. Critters such as the dzoo-no-qua, which is very resis-\ntant to magic and quite a physical threat, makes an excellent\nchoice for this purpose. Nimue’s salamanders, which can drain or\nneutralize magic, make good adversaries as well. Remember that\neven the least intelligent dual critter can fight a spell cast at it in\nastral combat rather than make a simple Resistance Test.\n\nMundane vs. Magician\n\nInstead of creating magician NPCs to oppose player character\nmagicians, simply use large numbers of mundane NPCs to even\nthe odds. For example, there's no reason a gamemaster must cre-\nate a magical opponent to keep a street mage character busy—a\ndozen gangers will keep him occupied just as well.\n\nCountering a magical player character with large numbers of\nmundane NPCs can also be fun for the player character, because\nhe can really let loose without worrying about Spell Defenses or\nmagical counterattacks. Such confrontations can show just how\ntough magicians on all-out offense can be.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPeantion"

        "text": "Keep in mind that mundane opponents can be more than just\n“cannon fodder” for magician player characters. Most corporate\nsecurity forces, for example, know enough about magic to limit\nthe magician’s line of sight. And nearly every NPC on the street\n\nknows enough to “geek the mage\nfirst” when the bullets and spells\nstart flying.\n\nCREATING\nPRIME RUNNERS\n\nDesigning non-player char-\nacter opponents that are powerful\nenough to genuinely threaten\nplayer characters yet vulnerable\nto defeat is one of the keys to run-\nning fun, engaging Shadowrun\ngames, There is no way to create\na single set of game statistics for\nsuch NPC opponents that will\nprove equally effective in all\nShadowrun games, however,\nsimply because the player charac-\nters in each individual game pos-\nsess unique strengths and weak-\nnesses. This section offers a\nmethod for creating the prime\nrunners every shadowrunning\nteam faces in the course of doing\nbusiness. This system also allows\ngamemasters to tailor the powers\nof known runners such as\nFastjack, Hatchetman, Argent.\nMagister and other published,\nhigh-profile runners to the level of\ntheir groups’ teams, simply by\ndeciding how a prime runner\ncompares to the shadowrunners\nin the group.\n\nThe system provides frame-\nworks for creating five broad\ntypes and ratings of NPC oppo-\nnents: Inferior, Equal, Superior,\nSupreme and Superhuman. The\ndescription of each type suggests\nstatistic levels for the NPC that are\nbased on the statistics of the play\ner characters the NPC will face. In\nother words, the gamemaster will\ntailor the NPC prime runners to\naccommodate the relative strength of the player characters\n\nThe description for each opponent level suggests a range of\nThreat Ratings. Varying the Threat Rating of each opponent and\noccasionally increasing or decreasing the Threat Rating during the\ncourse of a campaign helps keep players guessing about the actu-\nal power of their opponents, Each NPC opponent should also pos-\nsess a Professional Rating (see p. 187, SRII) to determine how the\n\ni ADUANCED RULES\nwal\n\nNPC reacts in a fight. For example, an Inferior/Trained opponent\n(Professional Rating 3) may possess lower Skill Ratings and abill-\nties than most player characters, but she will take a lot of abuse\nbefore giving up a fight. On the other hand, a Superior/Average\n(Professional Rating 1) opponent\nmay be highly skilled but will\nhave little stomach for battle.\nThe following classifications\nmay be useful for gamemasters\ncreating Enemies (see p. 71)\n\nINFERIOR\n\nAn NPC who is rated as\nInferior to the player characters\nmay still be a prime runner.\nPower and influence can be mea-\nsured in many ways beyond\nstrength, intelligence, nuyen,\nequipment, contacts and all the\nother ways runners rank them-\nselves against their peers. For\nexample, an opponent need\nhold only one item of informa-\ntion that the players would find\ninconvenient if it was revealed,\nand that NPC automatically ranks\nas a threat, even if that informa-\ntion is his or her only advantage.\n\nInferior NPCs possess Skill\nand Attribute Ratings 1-2 points\nlower than the Skill and Attribute\nRatings of the average player\ncharacter in a campaign.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, a\nsingle player character Is a match\nfor 2-3 Inferior NPCs. Inferior\ncharacters may be very compe\ntent—they just aren't in the\nleague of the player characters.\n\nInferior characters have\nThreat Ratings from 1-2. At an\nappropriate moment during\ncombat, the gamemaster may\nincrease the NPC's Threat Rating\nto 3 to represent a one-time\nboost of energy (similar to a\ncharacter's use of Karma dice)\n\nEQUAL\n\nAn NPC who is rated Equal to\nthe player characters possesses Skill and Attribute Ratings that are\nroughly equal to the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the play-\ner characters in the campaign.\n\nThese NPCs are the peers (and perhaps the rivals) of the cam-\npaign’s player characters.

Depending on the general skill level and competence of the\nplayer characters, they may have many peers or very few.\n\nGamemasters should play Equal NPCs with Dice Pools or\nThreat Ratings of 3-5. At an appropriate moment during combat,\nthe gamemaster may increase the NPC's Threat Rating to 6 to rep-\nresent a one-time boost of energy (similar to a character's use of\nKarma dice).\n\nSUPERIOR\n\nSuperior NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 1-2 points\nhigher than the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the player\ncharacters in a campaign.\n\nSuperior NPCs enjoy an edge in experience, talent or just\nplain luck that makes them better than their player-character\ncounterparts. Consequently, a single Superior character is an even\nmatch for 2 player characters.\n\nGamemasters may find it more effective to use Dice Pools to\nreflect the superior abilities of these NPCs. If he or she prefers to\nuse a Threat Rating, the Threat Rating should equal the average of\nthe shadowrunner teams’ Dice Pools for the opponent's specialty.\nFor example, a Superior street samurai would have a Threat Rating\nequal to the average of the Combat Pool Dice of the shadowrun-\nner team.\n\nBecause they wield far more power than Equal or Inferior\nNPCs, Superior NPCs should show up only rarely in campaigns.\n\nSUPERHUMAN\n\nSuperhuman NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 3 or\nmore points higher than the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of\nthe player characters in a campaign. These NPCs are the best at\nwhat they do, They are the cream of the crop, legends of the\nstreets, spoken of with respect and awe. These NPCs make good\nfoils for reminding player characters of their own mortality and\nlimits, or good aciversaries for a group of very capable characters.\n\nUsually. a single Superhuman NPC provides an even match\nfor an entire team of player characters.\n\nThe Dice Pools (and Threat Ratings: see above) of\nSuperhuman NPCs are |-3 points higher than the average Dice\nPools of the player characters. Add the Threat Rating to all tests\nthe NPC makes.\n\nULTIMATE\n\nThe powers of Ultimate NPC opponents are off the scale.\nThese opponents include great dragons, powerful spirits, ancient\nimmortals, godlike Als and other entities that are so powerful they\ndon’t need game statistics. Gamemasters simply determine their\nexact powers to sult the current campaign and set an appropriate\nmeasurement to describe their characteristics as needed.\n\nBecause Ultimate NPCs are so powerful, they function more\nlike plot devices than standard NPC characters. Player characters\nmight be able to thwart some of the plans and schemes of an\nUltimate NPC, but no mortal has a prayer of surviving a direct con-\nfrontation with an Ultimate opponent.\n\nUse Ultimate NPC opponents very sparingly. They really\ndon't need Dice Pools or Threat Ratings. Just keep rolling until\nthey succeed—that's one of the reasons they are called Ultimate.\n\nSTATE OF THE ART\n\nThe state-of-the-art (SOTA) rules provide game mechanics for\nsimulating the steady advance of technology. the costs of keeping\nup with the latest technology and the disadvantages of not keep-\ning up with technological innovations. In addition to helping the\ngamemaster convey the unstoppable rush of technological\nimprovement that is an essential part of Shadowrun, the SOTA\nsystem provides a convenient way to reduce the amounts of\nnuyen and Good Karma characters possess and reduce overly\npowerful characters’ skill and equipment ratings/bonuses.\n\nWhile SOTA rules also apply to NPCs, gamemasters need not\nmanage the details of every gamemaster character's relationship\nto the SOTA. He or she should simply keep in mind that the run-\nners’ opposition may also occasionally struggle to maintain the\ncutting edge and take care to not assume that all NPCs come\nequipped with the latest innovations and most recent discoveries\nin every field.\n\nThe Virtual Realities 2.0 sourcebook provides SOTA rules for\ndeckers. The following SOTA rules apply to other areas of the\nShadowrun universe. General rules regarding the use of SOTA are\nfollowed by rules for determining the field of SOTA advancement\nand specific rules for the effects of advancement in each field.\nGamemasters can advance the SOTA in their campaigns after each\nadventure, once per game-year, or at any interval in between.\n\nLIFESTYLE COST REDUCTIONS\n\nTo reflect the greater opportunities and advantages enjoyed\nby successful characters, any character who maintains a Luxury or\nHigh lifestyle receives an automatic SOTA cost reduction. A char-\nacter with a Luxury lifestyle may reduce the final nuyen cost of a\nSOTA advance by 25 percent. A character with a High lifestyle\nmay reduce the final nuyen cost of a SOTA advance by 10 percent.\n\nCYBERWARE COSTS\n\nThe advent of beta and delta-grade cyberware has made\nalpha-grade cyberware far more available—but certainly not\ncheaper, To reflect this change, the Street Index and Availability\nfor alpha-grade cyberware is now the same as for standard-grade\ncyberware. This means that players may choose alpha-grade\ncyberware for their characters during character creation. Because\nneither the Essence nor nuyen cost changed, however, the player\nmust now decide whether to pay extra nuyen for the higher-grade\ncyberware, or to save on the Essence cost. (See the Street\nSamurai Catalog and Cybertechnology for rules and costs of\nalpha-grade cyberware.)\n\nAlpha and standard-grade cyberware Is subject to the SOTA\ncosts described in the various fields of SOTA advancement. Beta\nand delta-grade cyberware is immune to the SOTA—for now.\nCharacters who use cheap or second-hand cyberware must\nincrease the SOTA cost by 20 percent.\n\nFALLING BEHIND THE SOTA CURVE\n\nAny character who fails to pay the SOTA Factor cost of a\nSOTA advance suffers the penalties described. The character may\nreverse these penalties by paying the appropriate SOTA Factor\ncost any time before the next SOTA advancement in that field.\n\nSHADOWRUN COMPANION"

Perhaps the player is\nsimply tired of playing that character; maybe the gamemaster\ndecides that a character has become too powerful or will not be\nable to play a useful role in the current campaign; perhaps the\ngamemaster and player initially agreed that the character would\ndie at the end of a specific story line, but at the moment of truth\nneither really wants to let the character disappear from the game\ncompletely. In this case, the player may agree to hand over con-\ntrol of the character to the gamemaster, and the character may\ntake on a completely new life as a friend or foe of the shad-\nowrunner team.\n\nDepending on the circumstances of their leaving the team,\nex-runners may stand willing and ready to help their former team-\nmates whenever and in whatever way is needed at a moments’\nnotice. As a fixer or a Mr. Johnson, the character may serve as the\nteam’s primary resource for work, or may simply be a constant,\ninexpensive source of information and contacts. A character who\nchooses not to pursue a second career and decides to simply live\non his or her savings may be persuaded to come out of retirement\nfor “one more big score” or to get his old team out of a jam, espe-\ncially if the team made very powerful enemies before the player\ncharacter left (\"Remember that comm line we tapped back in ‘55?\nUnfortunately for us, it turns out that that was Lofwyr's private\nLTG. He'd like us to come to a meet and discuss the conse-\nquences of our actions ... .”).\n\nOn the other hand, they may actively seek to aid the team's\nenemies and bring down their former chummers, An ex-runner\nmay have been an agent of a team's enemy working from the\ninside, or some sort of misunderstanding might have turned the\ncharacter against the team, leaving him or her ripe for recruitment\nby the enemy. In the best tradition of the spy genre (and\nShadowrun, for that matter), gamemasters may spin a complex\nweb of deceit, betrayal, double- or triple-crosses, regret and\nrevenge that keeps the former player character involved in the\ncampaign in newly sinister and morally complicated ways.\n\nRetired runners can remain active in a campaign in several\nways. Some may simply step back from the front lines and oper-\nate behind the scenes in relative safety. Others may come out of\nthe shaciows completely and put their experience to work in the\ncivilian or corporate worlds. The following section offers some\nideas for roles that retired runners can play in a campaign.\n\nRegardless of the role a retired character assumes, all retired\ncharacters act as Level 3 contacts for their former teammates.\nAdditionally, an ex-runner’s contacts can serve as friends-of-a-\nfriend for all team members. (See Friends of a Friend, p. 63, for\nmore information about FOFs).\n\nSECOND CAREERS\n\nEx-shadowrunners often have a wide variety of skills that\nenable them to earn a living in numerous ways. Some of the less\ntraditional choices for a second career include: urban brawl player\nor combat-biker, Matrix consultant, Doc Wagon employee, magi-\ncal researcher, street doc, military advisor, talismonger, corporate\nwage slave and simsense star (an ever-popular choice).\n\nEx-runners may also choose second careers more closely\nrelated to the work they did as shadowrunners.\n\n“Hello. I'm Mr. Johnson.”\n\nUsually, former shadowrunners are well-suited to act as “Mr.\nJohnsons.” Typically, a former runner is intimately familiar with\nhow a shadowrun is orchestrated, which can give such a charac-\nter valuable insight into the potential risks and profits of a run. Ex-\nrunners are also likely to know at least some of the shadowrunners\noperating in an area and be better able to pick the right people for\na job. But perhaps most important, most shadowrunners will be\nmore likely to trust an ex-runner rather than a Johnson who has\nspent his career behind a desk.\n\nThe same characteristics also make ex-runners well-suited to\nact as “talent agents” for shadowrunning teams. A character serv-\ning as an agent actively searches out the most lucrative jobs for\nher team and takes a percentage of the profits in return.\n\nIf an ex-runner character doesn't have a total of 6 contacts,\nthe gamemaster and former controlling player can select addi-\ntional contacts to bring the number to 6.\n\n“| Got What You're Looking For”\n\nAny runner character who retires with some money may set\nhimself up as a fixer. A former shadowrunner would likely have\nthe contacts needed to obtain hard-to-find pieces of equipment\nand to fence the kind of drek-hot paydata and trinkets that runners\ntend to collect. Furthermore, most retired runners have dealt with\nfixers often and are fairly familiar with that aspect of the business.\n\nAs a sideline, many fixers also arrange runners for indepen-\ndent shadowruns or act as intermediaries between corporations\nand runners. Such activities are practically required for fixers who\ndeal primarily in information.\n\nAny former runner who sets up shop as a fixer may select\ncontacts to bring his total number of contacts to 6. Fixers tend to\nspecialize, so players may wish to select contacts that reflect the\ncharacter's specialty.\n\n“I Know How These Scum Operate”\n\nSometimes it takes a rat to catch a rat. Corporations recog-\nnize this fact, and often hire former shadowrunners to work as cor-\nporate security specialists, trainers, guards, security deckers and\nso on. Some ex-runners even set up their own private security\nconsulting firms and sell their services to the corporations they\nused to run against.\n\n“Hey, I'm Clean”\n\nAny ex-runner who retires with a bit of cash can set up a\n“legitimate” business. (Some characters may even open a shop\nbefore they retire, though this involves a much greater risk in the\nevent that their cover is blown.) Every legal business owner must\nhave a SIN (even if it’s just a counterfeit one), as well as the prop-\ner permits and registrations. Some popular businesses for ex-\nshadowrunners include weapons stores (for former street sams\nand mercs), talismonger shops (for former magicians), electron-\nics/computer stores (for ex-deckers) and vehicle repair (for former\nriggers).\n\nOpening any business requires an initial investment. The\nentrepreneur must buy base inventory and purchase or lease any\nrequired facilities. For most businesses, these costs can be deter-\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPepantion"

Keep in mind that a character\nmaking legal purchases need not worry about the Street Index of\nlegal items, facilities or shops.\n\nBusiness and operating permits can cost anywhere from 100\nto 1,000 nuyen or more, depending on the type of business—for\nexample, a permit for a registered security agency will cost con-\nsiderably more than a permit for a talismonger shop or a courier\nbusiness. Individual gamemasters may set permit costs in their\ncampaigns.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that a “legitimate” business owner need\nnot restrict herself to legal means to operate her business. “Hot”\nmerchandise and alternative funding sources (loan sharks, bank\nheists and so on) are just two shady practices that may spell\ninstant success (or eventual ruin) for a would-be business owner,\n\nDEFECTING TEAM MEMBERS\n\nAccording to the standard rules, a group's Team Karma Pool\nis reduced by half whenever a character leaves a group (see p.\n191, SRI). Consequently, team members may put pressure on\ntheir fellow player characters to remain on their team, and players\nmay be reluctant to stop playing their characters for fear of putting\nthe remaining team members at a severe disadvantage\n\nTo lessen these pressures and make retirement a more desir-\nable option for player characters, gamemasters may waive this\nTeam Karma penalty when a character leaves a group on good\nterms. Instead, divide the total Team Karma Pool by the number\nof team members (round up) to determine each member's\n“share” of the Team Karma Pool. When a player leaves, simply\nreduce the Team Karma Pool by his share. The defecting player\ndoes not receive the Karma Points—they are simply gone.\n\nIf a player leaves a team on bad or indifferent terms, reduce\nthe Team Karma Pool by half, per standard rules.\n\nIf a character ever wishes to return to a former team, he must\ncontribute Karma to the Team Karma Pool according to the stan-\ndard rules for a new member of the group before he can use that\nKarma Pool.\n\nINTEGRATING NEW TEAM MEMBERS\n\nFew gaming groups are willing to start a new campaign just\nto add a new player or player character. Every time a new player\nwants to join the game, however, or a new player character needs\nto join the team because a former character retired or died or\nbecause the team is lacking a necessary skill, the group must find\na way to successfully integrate new characters into the existing\nshadowrunning team.\n\nUsing the team's contacts is perhaps the simplest way to\nintroduce new characters to a group. A contact may introduce a\nnew character at virtually any time and place.\n\nFollowing the contact’s introduction of a new character or in\nplace of it, a team might hold a “trial run” to test prospective team\nmembers. Gamemasters can easily fill such runs with interesting\nand fun surprises, because the prospective member and the team\nwill be unfamiliar with each other's skills, abilities, work methods,\npersonalities and so on.\n\n6g\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPepanion"

Gamemasters can use nearly\nany element already present in their\ncampaigns—Edges and Flaws, train-\ning. background stories, common\nenemies—to get a new player onto an\nexisting shadowrunning team.\n\nOPTIONAL RULES\n\nThe following rules offer options\nfor certain facets of the game that\nmany players already tweak using\nhouse rules. As with all the rules and\nsystems in this book, players and\ngamemasters should agree on which\noptional rules will be incorporated\ninto their game before using any\noptional rules.\n\nAVAILABILITY\n\nINTIMIDATION TEST MODIFIERS TABLE\n\nCondition\n\nIntimidator's Charisma Rating is 5-6\n\nIntimidator's Charisma Rating is 7 or higher\n\nControl Thoughts/Emotions spell cast on subject\nIntimidator is larger/taller than subject\n\nIntimidator's Strength more than twice subject's\n\nNumbers advantage\n\nIntimidator is wearing visible armor, cyberware, or weapon\nIntimidator performs visible magic or superhuman feat\nSubject’s death imminent (gun to head, and so on)\n\nSubject has Professional Rating\n\nSubject has “ace in the hole”\n\nSubject is oblivious to danger\n\nSubject is intoxicated\n\nSubject doesn’t think Intimidator “would try something so stupid”\nSubject has superhuman advantages\n\nSubject’s Charisma Rating is 5-6\n\nSubject’s Charisma Rating is 7 or higher\n\nTarget Modifier\n-1\n\n-2\n\n+/-1 per success\n-1\n\n-1\n\n+/-2\n\n-I\n\n—2\n\n2\n\n+ Rating\n\n+2\n\n+2\n\n+1\n\n+1\n\nNegate bonuses\n+1\n\n+2\n\nAccording to the standard rules,\nplayers may not purchase any gear for\ntheir characters during character creation that has a Rating higher\nthan 6. While this effectively serves to prevent characters from\nbeginning the game with high-end government- and corporate-\nlevel gear, it fails to account for the fact that certain legally avail-\nable items are also very difficult to obtain. To reflect the concept\nof limited-edition or hard-to-get items (and to keep characters a\nlittle less powerful at character creation), use the following rule.\nNo character may start the game with a piece of gear with an\nAvailability of greater than 6. (Think of it in terms of a Ferrari\nTestarossa. You may have seen one on TV, and if you live in a large\ncity you actually may have seen one on the street or at an auto\nshow. But owning one is out of the question—heck, you might\neven have to do research to find out where to buy one.) The\ngamemaster must use this rule if he or she is using the State-of-\nthe-Art Model Edge, p. 34.\n\nFACEDOWN TESTS\n\nOccasionally, a character will try to make an opponent back\ndown from a confrontation on the strength of his presence and\nreputation alone.\n\nFacing down an opponent in this manner requires a success-\nful Facedown Test. For the test, a character can use his Willpower\nor Charisma Attribute (whichever is higher) plus a number of dice\nequal to his Karma Pool (NPCs use a number of dice equal to their\nThreat Ratings). Karma Points are not actually spent for the test—\nthe Karma Pool is simply used as a measure of the character's rep-\nutation. The Facedown Test target number equals the opponent's\nWillpower.\n\nIn turn, the target of the facedown makes an opposing\nWillpower Test to resist. The test target number equals the rating\nof the Attribute the character Is using for his or her test.\n\nThe character who scores the most successes wins the test\nand forces his opponent to back down.\n\nA character who loses a Faceciown Test and decides to attack\nthe winner suffers a +1 target number penalty for every 2 points\nin his Margin of Failure.\n\nINTIMIDATION CONCENTRATION\n\nSometimes it's not how you say it—it’s how LOUD you say it,\n\nIntimidation, a new Concentration of the Negotiation Skill,\nrepresents this principle. By making a successful Intimidation\nTest(s), a character can make a subject answer questions he\nwouldn't answer otherwise or give in to other demands.\n\nThe Intimidation Test Modifiers Table provides target modi-\nfiers for Intimidation Tests. (The modifiers may also be used for any\ntests of Negotiation or its Concentrations, including Interrogation.)\n\nIf desired, gamemasters may allow subjects of intimidation\nattempts to make opposing Willpower Tests to resist. Such a test\nuses a target number equal to the Skill Rating of the intimidator.\n\nIf the intimidator generates more successes, the subject spills\nthe proverbial beans. Gamemasters can use the Contact Knowledge\nTable (p. 69) to determine how much a subject knows and reveals.\nIf appropriate, the subject does the intimidator’s bidding.\n\nIf the target of the intimidation generates more successes, he\nresists attempts to coerce him and does not reveal information. In\nfact, the subject may deliberately feed his would-be intimidator\nfalse information to set up his tormentor.\n\nIndividual gamemasters can allow roleplaying to dictate the\nexact details of an intimidation attempt or interrogation. Such\ninteractions have no time limits; a gamemaster can clecide that a\nsingle opposed Intimidation Test will decide the outcome of a\ninterrogation session or instruct players to make tests for every\nquestion or at specific time intervals.\n\nSpecializations of Intimidation include Browbeating, Death\nThreats, Business Ruining, Threatening Family, and Long-Term\nHassle.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPpanton"

        "text": "PERCEPTION AND STEALTH\n\nVery often, a shadowrunner's best course of action is to\nremain undetected. However, anyone listening or watching for a\nrunner need only make a successful Perception (4) Test to notice\nsomeone sneaking around (see p. 185, SRI). Even though differ-\nent conditions add target modifiers to the Perception Test, it gen-\nerally remains a fairly easy task.\n\nTo make sneaking about a bit easier, gamemasters may allow\ncharacters to make opposing Steaith (4) Tests whenever someone\nattempts to detect them. Every success generated on the Stealth\nTest increases the Perception Test target number by 1.\nGamemasters may also apply target modifiers to the Stealth Test\nto reflect any conditions that affect the character's ability to\nremain concealed, such as running, wounds and moving over bro-\nken glass.\n\nGamemasters determine when opposing Stealth Tests are\nappropriate. Note that the Stealth Skill does not make characters\ninvisible. If a character is walking through the middle of an empty\nroom, even 10 successes on a Stealth Test should not hide him\nfrom a guard who's looking for him.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nDeadlier Over-Damage\n\nUnder the standard rules, killing a character (especially a char-\nacter with a high Body Attribute) with a single shot takes a lot of\ndoing. In fact, it's nearly impossible. Indeed, the standard rules\nmake it possible for a troll to survive for more than an hour even\nafter taking a shot from a Panther assault cannon square in the\nhead!\n\nideally, this rule prevents characters from certain death as a\nresult of single, unexpected attacks and thus improves game play.\nBut as the example of the troll shows, it also can create some\nridiculous situations. To remedy this problem, gamemasters can\napply the Deadlier Over-Damage rule (based on the over-damage\nrule from p. 79, Fields of Fire).\n\nUnder the Deadlier Over-Damage rule, over-damage applies\nwhenever the Power of an attack is greater than the target's Body\nmultiplied by 1.5. (For an even deadlier game, apply over-damage\nwhenever the Power of an attack is greater than the target's\nBody.)\n\nOver-damage Is simply damage created by extra successes\nafter a weapon's Damage Level has been staged up to “D.” Every\n2 extra successes translate into | additional Damage Point, which\nis applied against the target's Physical Condition Monitor (if the\nattack caused Deadly Stun damage) or Body Overflow (if the\nattack caused Deadly Physical damage).\n\nFatigue\n\nNo one can run forever—figuratively or literally. The big bad\nmegacorp will eventually track down the shadowrunner who\nextracted its most valuable exec, and after a period of sprinting\neven the most conditioned athlete begins to slow down. The\nFatigue rule simulates the latter phenomenon.\n\nUnder the Fatigue rule, a character can sprint for a number of\nturns equal to half her Body (rounding up) before she begins to\n\nlose steam. If the character continues to run beyond this base peri-\nod, she begins taking Fatigue damage. The base damage is 4L\n(Stun), and can be staged down with an Athletics Test or an\nAthletics (Running) Test. (If a character is not sprinting, but is\nmerely running or jogging, the gamemaster may increase the\nbase period.)\n\nEach time the character repeats the Skill Test (successfully or\nnot) she can run for an additional number of turns equal to half her\nBody, suffering Fatigue damage at the end of each base period.\nThe character may attempt to stage down the Fatigue damage\nusing an Athletics Test or an Athletics (Running) Test, but the\nPower of the Fatigue damage doubles for each subsequent test.\nFor example, if a character has a Body of 4, he may sprint for 2\nturns, then must take 4L damage or make a successful Athletics\nTest or Athletics (Running) Test to stage down the damage. He\ncan then sprint for another 2 turns, then must take 8L damage or\nmake a successful Athletics Test or Athletics (Running) Test to\nstage down the damage.\n\nEventually, the runner will take enough Stun damage to con-\nvince her to stop running, or she will reach Deadly on the Stun\nCondition Monitor and will collapse from exhaustion. A character\nwho collapses from exhaustion is not unconscious—she is simply\nunable to continue any sort of strenuous activity.\n\nGenerally, Fatigue damage has the same game effects as Stun\ndamage. However, Fatigue damage reflects exhaustion and\naching muscles more than actual injury, and so it does not con-\ntribute to a character falling unconsciousness due to other Stun\ndamage and/or to a character's death from accumulated damage.\nCharacters may heal Fatigue damage as if it were standard Stun\n\ndamage.\n\nGrenade/Explosives Damage\n\nUnder standard rules, the destructive force of grenades and\nother explosives is dependent on the Throwing or Demolitions\nSkill of the attacking character. This arrangement reflects the fact\nthat a better throw or cleaner detonation will improve the destruc-\ntive force of an explosion.\n\nUnder the optional grenade/explosives damage rule, the\ngamemaster uses the Power of a grenacie/explosive to stage the\ndamage it causes. In other words, the gamemaster rolls a num-\nber of dice equal to half the grenade/explosive's Power (round\nup) against a Target Number 4. Then, the gamemaster uses the\nsuccesses from this test to stage up the grenade/explosive's\nDamage Level.\n\nThis rule can be especially useful when determining the\neffects of exploding grenades set as booby traps.\n\nFenris has left 6 kilos of C-6 plastic explosive\nlaying around (careless of him, isn’t it?). Fenris’s\nchummer, O. B. Stein, is standing a few feet away\nfrom the C-6 when it unexpectedly detonates.\n\nUsing the formula for determining the Damage\nof explosives (p. 242, SRIl), the gamemaster deter-\nmines that the C-6's Power is 15 and its Damage\nLevel is Deadly. (Because Fenris did not detonate the\nC-6 intentionally, the gamemaster decides that\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

B. suffers,\nthe gamemaster rolls 8 dice (half the C-6 Power.\nrounded up) against a Target Number 4. The roll gen\nerates 4 successes. The C-6's original Damage Level\nwas Deadly, so these successes add 2 points of over-\ndamage (see Deadlier Over-Damage).\n\nUnsurprisingly, O. B. generates no successes on\nhis Damage Resistance Test, and he dies instantly\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPanion\n\nADVANCED RULES\n» dae\n\nMovement Option\n\nUnder the standard movement rules, during a Combat Phase\na character can run a number of meters equal to his Quickness\nRating multiplied by his running modifier (p. 83, SRM), This is an\nadequate, but sometimes too imprecise, measure of how far a\ncharacter can move and how quickly. Some gamemasters and\nplayers want a more rigorous breakciown in order to determine\nexactly what is happening during each moment of a turn, espe-\ncially during combat, when each movement may have repercus-\nsions based on the timing of events.\n\nTo use the movement option, players calculate a character's\nrunning movement during a Combat Phase according to the stan-\ndard rules, then divide the result by 10 (rounding up). This allows\nthe player and gamemaster to determine exactly how far the char-\nacter can move during each moment of the Combat Phase, from\nthe highest Initiative to the end of the initial set of actions. For\nexample, if a player character has a running movement of 18, he\nmay move 2 meters (18 + 10 = 1.8 rounded up to 2) during each\ndivision of time between actions in a Combat Phase. In other\nwords, if the character has an Initiative of 20, he may take his\naction at Initiative 20, then move 2 meters on Initiative 19, 18, 17\nand so on. At Initiative 10, the character may take another action,\nand move 2 meters on Initiative 9, 8, 7, 6 and so on.\n\nThis level of micro-management requires a substantial\namount of bookkeeping and will not suit every group's style of\nplay, but it may keep a character alive if his movement allows him\nto reach cover before his opponent's Initiative to fire.\n\nReach Bonus\n\nWhen using the Reach bonus rule, calculate the difference\nbetween the Reach Ratings of opponents.\n\nApply the difference as a negative target modifier to the\nattack tests of the opponent with the higher (longer) Reach. For\nexample, an opponent with a sword (Reach |) would apply a —-I\ntarget modifier to his attack tests against an unarmed opponent.\n\nUnlike the standard Reach rule, the Reach bonus provides no\ntarget modifier for the opponent with the lower Reach Rating\n\nMAGIC\n\nExclusive-Sustained Spell\n\nThe exclusive-sustained spell rule enables a magician to take\nFree Actions while sustaining a spell, without incurring the stan-\ndard +2 modifier for sustaining a spell. If he chooses to use this\nrule, a magician may take no other magical actions while the\nexclusive-sustained spell is in effect, and make take only | Free\nAction per turn, If the magician performs more than | Free Action\nper turn, he must apply the standard +2 modifier to all tests for\nthose actions\n\nThe exclusive-sustained spell rule can be quite useful when\nsustaining spells such as Barrier and Shapechange\n\nSpirit Combat\n\nIf gamemasters feel that their player characters are defeating\nmanifest spirits too easily, they may give all manifest spirits the\nparanormal animal power of Immunity to Normal Weapons.\n\nV7"

The best gamemasters have fun while gamemastering\nand do their best to make sure their players enjoy themselves,\ntoo. Rules and systems and such are intended to help create fun\nand satisfying games—they are not ends in themselves. Don't get\nso caught up in game mechanics that you lose sight of the most\nimportant goal—having fun.\n\nBREAKING THE RULES\n\nIf you played cops and robbers as a kid, you probably remem-\nber playing pretend as a lot of fun, just like roleplaying. You're also\nlikely to recall at least one argument along the lines of “I shot you!”\n“Did not, you missed!” “No | didn't!\" and on and on. Roleplaying\ngames are just a more sophisticated versions of cops and robbers—\nthe main difference is that roleplaying games provide rules to help\ndetermine whether or not your shot really did hit.\n\nAll roleplaying rules are simply guidelines to help reduce\narguments over what really happened during a game. They help\nus to visualize and experience events In the story as they unfold.\nBut sometimes the rules can trigger arguments, hinder creative\nplayers and gamemasters, and otherwise get in the way of every-\none’s enjoyment of the game.\n\nThat's when gamemasters need to fall back on the old adage,\n“rules are made to be broken.” Slavish devotion to the rules of the\ngame is not always the best way to have fun. If a particular rule\ndoesn't work for a particular scene or action, feel free to ignore or\nmodify it. Many groups even develop “house rules” over time, rules\nthat are uniquely tailored to the group’s needs and style of play.\n\nStay flexible about the rules—they are designed to serve the\ngame, not the other way around.\n\nKEYS TO GAMEMASTERING SUCCESS\n\nNo matter what type of game or campaign you run or want\nto run, the following rules of thumb can help you create the best\ngame/campaign possible.\n\nBE INFORMED!\n\nEven the simplest, most straightforward game contains plen-\nty of things the gamemaster must monitor. Players need only keep\ntrack of a single character, but the gamemaster must keep track of\nall of the player characters, as well as non-player characters\n(NPCs), the major events of the campaign, the flow of the adven-\nture and all of the other little details that make the game world\ncome alive for the players. Consequently, every gamemaster\nshould strive to be informed at all times.\n\nOrganizing all of your information for a particular game—and\nkeeping it organized throughout the game—is probably the most\nimportant step for keeping track of everything. Maintain a running\nlist of the major characters and a few notes about each character's\nappearance and personality, as well as a list of the major events in\nthe adventure. For some gamemasters, these lists contain enough\ninformation to run an entire adventure. Other gamemasters may\nwant to keep detailed maps, characters’ statistics and other refer-\nences on hand.\n\nCreating detailed notes of the events of each game session\ncan help you keep the important information straight. Review\nyour notes at the beginning of each game session to refresh your\nmemory of what happened during the last session and what is\ngoing on In the campaign. Go over your notes after each session,\nclean up and expand any notes you hastily jotted down during the\ngame and organize your notes for the next game. A few minutes\nspent reviewing and organizing your notes before and after game\nsessions can help you keep on top of things.\n\nIf your group includes players who like to keep notes about\nwhat their characters see and do, ask to read these notes at the\nend of each game session. Players might note important points\nthat you didn't write down. Players’ notes might also offer excel-\nlent insight into how your players see events in your game and\nwhat they believe is important—which may be different from\nwhat you think is important. Such information can help you keep\nyour campaign interesting for your players.\n\nIf you do forget some detail or get things confused, just say\n“Oops!”, correct the mistake as best you can and move on.\nArguing with players or forcing them to accept your word over\nsome small detail can quickly spoil a game session, Remember,\n\nyour main goal is having fun.\n\nBE KNOWLEDGEABLE!\n\nAny gamemaster should be well acquainted with the game\nhe or she is running. That doesn’t mean that you have to be able\nto quote the rules from memory. It simply means that you're at\nleast familiar with the game's basic rules and know where to find\nexplanations of other rules as needed.\n\nShadowrun provides many supplementary rules and rule-\nbooks beyond the main rulebook, and nobody can be expected to\nmemorize them all (even we have to look things up). Focus on\nlearning the basic rules from the main Shadowrun rulebook and\nthe rules that are important to the player characters in your group.\nFor example, if your group contains a rigger character, you'll need\nto be fairly conversant with the vehicle rules. If your group con-\ntains a decker character, learn the Matrix rules; if your group con-\ntains one or two magician characters, magic rules will be impor-\ntant.\n\nGamemaster screens and notes are two excellent ways to\nkeep information on often-used rules close at hand and can spare\na gamemaster from the need to search through a rulebook during\nthe middle of a game. The Shadowrun gamemaster screen out-\nlines the most commonly used procedures and numbers.\nSimilarly, making notes about some of the other major rules like-\nly to come up in an adventure can also save time and keep the\ngame moving. For example, if you know that an upcoming scene\ncontains an ambush, look up the Ambush rules and make some\nnotes you can use when the time comes.\n\nGenerally, keeping the game moving is more important than\nspending a lot of game time looking up rules (unless you are just\nlearning the game, of course). If you don’t know the answer to a\nspecific rules question, don’t hesitate to make a decision based on\nyour own judgment and tell your players, “This is how we're\ngoing to do it for now.” You can look up the specific rule after the\n\nSHADOWRUN COomePeantion"

If\nyou have a question about an important rule, don’t be afraid to\ntake the time to look up the rule. No gamemaster (or player) is\nperfect; even the most experienced players have to look up rules\nevery now and then.\n\nBE FAIR!\n\nToo many players believe that the gamemaster is their char-\nacter's enemy in a roleplaying game. Though gamemasters con-\ntrol non-player opponents of their players’ characters, the\ngamemaster and his or her players are, in fact, on the “same\nside\"—both should work together to create a good story.\nTherefore, gamemasters always should strive to play fair when rul-\ning for or against the players. Don’t make things too easy for your\nplayer characters, but don’t needlessly penalize them, either—\nespecially if their dice rolls seem to be low on a particular night.\n\nBeing consistent is probably the most important part of being\nfair. If you are going to use a variant rule in your game, make sure\nyou apply that rule variation whenever the appropriate situation\narises. If you allow your player-characters to have a specific advan-\ntage not mentioned in the standard rules, give their enemies the\nsame advantage. Keep “special cases” and exceptions to a mini-\nmum. Players can become frustrated quite quickly if a gamemas-\nter continually changes the rules or makes exceptions.\n\nGamemasters should take care to keep their NPCs from being\nomniscient; these characters shouldn't know everything that the\ngamemaster knows. Though gamemasters control NPCs, NPCs\nshould not act on information that would not reasonably be avail-\nable to them. Avoid the temptation to use NPCs to crush a clever\nplan from your players simply because they came up with some-\nthing you did not think of in advance.\n\nBE REALISTIC!\n\nOr more precisely, strive for verisimilitude—the appearance\nof reality—in your games. Granted, a world that contains troll\ngangsters and corporate dragons can hardly be called “realistic,”\nbut all Shadowrun products are designed to create a fictional\nworld with the complexity of real life, and such complexity makes\nfor more interesting games.\n\nNPCs are a great place to start fleshing out your campaign\nworld. Give your NPCs personalities, give them motives and\ndesires that drive them—even if those motives are unfathomable\nto your player characters. Give your NPCs personality quirks, likes\nand dislikes just like anyone else. Perhaps your heartless corporate\nJohnson who uses shadowrun teams and tosses them away like\nsnot-soaked tissue has a soft spot for kids because he grew up as\nan orphan on the hard streets. Maybe the toxic shaman in your\nadventure has a grudge against a particular person or corporation\nrather than simply hating all of humanity. Even faceless corporate\nguards have lives, friends and families. Having a helpless corpo-\nrate guard beg for his life while showing the runners a hologram\nof his three-year-old daughter might move even hardened play-\ner-characters to mercy.\n\nNPCs with personalities add realism to a game, and their actions\ncan be more unpredictable than one-climensional “bad guys” who\nonly want to kill the player characters or rule the world. If desired,\ngamemasters can even use the character-creation system to create\nnon-player characters with full statistics, gear, backgrounds, Edges\nand Flaws and even their own contacts and Enemies.\n\nFinally, have your NPCs behave consistently, according to\ntheir personalities, motives, desires and habits. If the guys at the\nlocal Lone Star station don’t usually bother the player characters,\nthey shouldn't start hassling the runners unless they have a par-\nticular reason to act against their usual habits.\n\nSimilarly, critters in your game should demonstrate motives.\nAnimals don't simply attack for no reason—they usually strike out\nof hunger, pain, fear or provocation. And they don't usually fight\nto the death unless they have no choice. Guard animals are\ntrained and placed in a specific area for a purpose, but wild ani-\nmals live where they can find food and shelter—so your player\ncharacters shouldn't run into a pack of Gabriel hounds in the\nBarrens unless someone put those hounds there.\n\nBE FLEXIBLE!\n\nPlayers almost never do what you expect them to do—that’s\nthe one sure thing that gamemasters can rely on when dealing\nwith players. Most players are very clever at coming up with new\nand innovative ways to wreck a gamemaster's carefully laid-out\nadventure plans. When that happens (and it will, sooner or later)\nthe gamemaster has two choices: resisting the players’ direction\nor going along with it.\n\nResisting the players’ direction usually entails forcing the\nplayers into situations they are trying their best to avoid. Players\ntend to be a stubborn lot, however, and so trying to force them\ninto a specific direction will probably make them fight it even\nharder.\n\nGoing along with the direction in which the players seem\nheaded is probably the better choice. That doesn’t mean a\ngamemaster has to give up his plans. It simply means he adjusts\nhis plans, allows the player characters to play out the events their\nactions lead to, and gradually guides the game back to the direc-\ntion he originally planned. By going in unexpected directions,\nplayers often provide suggestions that a gamemaster can use for\nfuture events and plot lines. Pay attention to their speculations\nand ideas during the game and use them later on. Discovering\nthat “they were right all along” gives the players a nice ego boost.\n\nBE TOUGH!\n\nProviding challenges for the player characters is an important\npart of any gamemaster's job. Don't give into the temptation to\nmake every shadowrun a cakewalk for your player characters, and\ndon't let them walk all over your NPCs. If the players don’t work and\nsweat to earn every Karma Point and every nuyen they receive,\nthen you're not pushing them hard enough. Shadowrun is an\nadventure game and the players are the “stars” of the adventure, so\nthey should have to face some dangerous opponents and survive\nsome harrowing escapes before they achieve their goals. Challenge\nyour player characters in every game, and your players will enjoy\ntheir rewards all the more because they worked for them.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "The Threat Rating system is a good way to fine tune the threat\nthat an opponent poses to player characters (see Threat Ratings,\np. 187, SRM). At times, gamemasters may also want to change or\nignore the result of dice rolls to maintain a threat to player char-\nacters. For example, if your major NPC throws a grenade into the\nmidst of the player characters and rolls all Is on his Attack Test,\nfeel free to ignore the result rather than have the main villain blow\nhimself up during an early encounter.\n\nBE KIND!\n\nAlways keep in mind that the gamemaster and the players\nshould work together to create an exciting story, Consequently,\ngamemasters may have to “fudge” dice rolls for player characters.\nFor example, a gamemaster doesn't have to kill a player character\nsimply because the player happened to roll badly on a Resistance\nTest or because an NPC got off a lucky shot. Quite frankly,\ngamemasters who measure their success in terms of killed char-\nacters will quickly find themselves without a group.\n\nBeing kind also means listening to what your players want\nout of the game and trying to include their interests in the story.\nA gamemaster who insists on running military/special forces\nadventures for a group of players who really want to explore the\nmetaplanes or play a gang in the Barrens is simply not doing his\nor her job.\n\nKEYS TO A GOOD ADVENTURE\n\nShadowrun is an adventure roleplaying game and the play-\ner characters, whether they are shadowrunners or not, take the\nroles of active figures in the Sixth World. They go out and have\nthe kind of adventures that would make for a good action novel\nor movie. (The point of roleplaying Is to step outside the roles we\nplay in real life. There's not much point in playing a librarian, lab\ntechnician, mechanic or retail clerk in Shadowrun.)\n\nThis section provides suggestions for creating satisfying\nadventures. Each subsection—The Premise, The Goal, The\nOpposition and Complications—focuses on a single component\nof a well-designed adventure.\n\nNote that Keys to a Good Adventure and the section that fol-\nlows, Plotting a Shadowrun Adventure, cio not present a step-\nby-step adventure creation system. Gamemasters and players\nmay create and assemble the various components of their adven-\ntures in any order they like.\n\nTHE PREMISE\n\nThe premise is the “story behind the story” of the adventure,\nthe basic plot that gets things going before the player characters\nget involved. It describes the scale of the adventure, creates the\nsetting of the adventure and hints at the adventure’s theme.\n\nThe scale of the adventure is the size of the story. A large-\nscale adventure might consist of the runners taking on a world-\nwide-conspiracy, while a small-scale adventure might involve tak-\ning on a single individual based in one city. The scale of an adven-\nture is important because taking on Lofwyr and Saeder-Krupp will\nbe very different than taking on a mid- or small-level corp.\n\nThe setting is simply where the main action will take place.\nThe setting consists of one or more locations—such as Seattle, or\n\nperhaps various locations around the world—and a milieu. The\nmilieu of a setting is simply the surroundings and environment.\nFor example, the milieu of an adventure centered around efforts\nto steal or protect a new prototype cyberdeck might be filled with\ndeckers, techno fixers, computer designers, lots of Matrix hard-\nware, plenty of decking and so on. The milieu of a search-and-res-\ncue mission in Bug City might be filled with insect spirits and\nshamans, ex-military personnel, loads of big guns, vicious fire\nfights, narrow escapes and other action-packed events.\n\nOnce the premise has been set, an NPC may hire the players to\ninvolve them in the story, or the players’ own personal goals or con-\ntacts may prompt them to become involved on their own initiative.\n\nGamemasters can make adventure premises as specific or as\ngeneral as they like. For example, a gamemaster designing a spe-\ncific premise may decide that a certain corporation (Corporation\nA) has developed some breakthrough technology for cybereyes.\nA rival corporation (Corporation B) wants to steal the research on\nthe new discovery so that it can complete the design and sell it\nfirst. The runners will become involved when an NPC from\nCorporation B hires the players to break into and steal the new\ntechnology from Corporation A.\n\nBy using a general premise, a gamemaster can give players\nmore control over the direction of the game or campaign. For\nexample, a gamemaster might decide that the players’ attempts\nto destroy a particular corporation (preferably a corp they already\nhave reason to hate) will be the general premise of a campaign.\nThe gamemaster will have to create some events to get the piay-\ners involved—perhaps the corp geeks some of their friends—and\nprovide the players with information about the corporation and its\nmajor characters. From there, the players themselves are free to\ndecide how they go about their task; the gamemaster simply fills\nin the details as events unfold.\n\nFor examples of premises and how they work within adven-\ntures, look at any Shadowrun adventure. Sourcebooks and sup-\nplements such as Bug City, Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon\nprovide plenty of information for creating general premises for\nadventures and campaigns.\n\nTHE GOAL\n\nStealing some important data, staying one step ahead of the\ncorporate hit team—every adventure needs a goal for the player\ncharacters. Clear-cut goals give the players something to shoot for\nand help keep an adventure on track.\n\nGamemasters can set adventure goals themselves, let players\nset goals, or work with their players when creating goals. In any\ncase, the adventure goal should always reflect the personalities\nand personal goals of the player characters. In fact, the personal\ngoals of player characters are an excellent basis for the overall\npremise of an adventure. In the corporate-downfall premise, for\nexample, each player should clearly define why his or her charac-\nter wants to see the corporation destroyed. Personal vendettas, a\ndesire for profit, a hatred of corporations in general, a sense of\nmoral outrage at the corporation's activities—any of these repre-\nsent valid personal goals.\n\nPlayer characters’ personal goals and motives provide a good\nindication of what kind of actions the characters are inclined to\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPpanton\n\na een"

By noting these motives, the gamemaster can create adven-\nture or campaign opportunities for the players to successfully role-\nplay their characters’ personalities and lifestyles.\n\nAfter determining the adventure goal, the gamemaster must\nprovide some possible ways the players can achieve the goal.\nPlayers often lose interest in an adventure that offers no clear\npaths to reach the goal. At the same time, don't try to force the\nplayers into a particular plan. Offer them a few alternate avenues\nso that they can decide themselves how to achieve the goal. And\ndon’t spell things out for them. The players don’t need to know\nexactly how they might accomplish their task—they simply need\nto be aware of the possibilities. Prepare for the unexpected—play-\ners sometimes devise very strange strategies to achieve a goal.\n\nTHE OPPOSITION\n\nEvery story needs one or more antagonists, or “bad guys,”\nand Shadowrun contains a broad range from which gamemasters\ncan choose. The antagonist is simply the main obstacle between\nthe player characters and their goal. An adventure antagonist can\nconsist of one or more individuals, a group or organization, a\ngreat dragon, and so on.\n\nDon't settle for one-dimensional, “cardboard” villains—the\nantagonist Is the main source of conflict and drama in an adven-\nture, and so make your NPC antagonists full-fledged characters,\nwith distinct personalities and motivations. Be thorough and care-\nful when creating the antagonist’s abilities and goals.\n\nComplex personalities and motives allow antagonists to act\nin unpredictable and unexpected ways. Additionally, player char-\nacters might be able to exploit an antagonist's personality or\nmotives during their attempts to overcome the opponent.\n\nCreating a personality and goals for an antagonist will also help\nthe gamemaster decide how powerful the opponent is and what\ntypes of methods the opponent will use to achieve his, her or its\ngoals, Some opponents may use subtle plots and tricks, even brain-\nwashing others to use as tools against the runners. Other opponents\nmay try to kill the runners outright. An antagonist such as Lofwyr\nmight “befriend” runners and spare their lives—so that he can call\nin his favor in the future when he needs someone to perform a sui-\ncidal mission or take the rap for a failed operation.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that NPCs represent only the “tradition-\nal” Shadowrun opponents. Anything that acts as an obstacle to\nthe players or threatens them can serve as an antagonist—non-\nmetahuman, even non-sentient beings, creatures, systems and so\non. A highly sophisticated security system. a hostile and\nAwakened wilderness, paranormal critters, even normal animais\ncan be used as antagonists. Using non-traditional opponents pro-\nvides both players and gamemasters with opportunities to stretch\ntheir skills, abilities and imaginations.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\n\nIf all shadowruns were as simple as gathering allies and blast-\ning through the opposition, they wouldn't be very exciting for long.\nHeck, if it were that easy, adventures would take an hour and\nShadowrun would have gone the way of the dodo. Complications\nare unexpected twists and turns that help keep things interesting\nand force the players and characters to stay alert.\n\nThrow in one, perhaps two, three, or more complications in\nevery adventure, A complication can be as simple as a piece of\nequipment failing or as complex as the adventure’s goal turning\nout to be something other than what the players originally\nbelieved, For example, a team performing a run in a Trans-Polar\nAleut nation with all the stealth technology and secrecy they can\nmuster might be attacked by a marauding gang—a “gang” that\njust happens to have the standard-issue weaponry of a corpora-\ntion the runner's fixer works with on a regular basis. The runners\nshould realize that something's rotten, and they'll have to change\ntheir plans accordingly. Or perhaps haifway through a corporate\nextraction, the targeted research scientist starts mumbling a mys-\nterious name. Just as the runners are about to deliver him to the\nJohnson, the scientist—who was supposed to be a willing extrac-\ntion—pops something into his mouth and dies moments later.\nTime to investigate him, the job, and their employer. Maybe the\nrunners perform a simple burglary, only to discover that the item\nthey've stolen belongs to a dragon's treasure hoard.\n\nFinally, gamemasters can always rely on that old stand-by,\nthe double-crossing Mr. johnson, who might lie about what corp\nhe’s from (if he's from one at all), set the runners up to be killed,\nnot pay them, decide they know too much, pay them in traceable\n“screamer” credsticks that transmit their locations to the cops, or\notherwise use them and “screw them over.”\n\nComplications are the main way to inject the unpredictability\nof “real life” into adventures, keep them interesting for players,\nand provide the “intrigue” that is one of Shadowrun’s distin-\nguishing characteristics. Like everything else in Shadowrun, how-\never, use complications judiciously. If you throw too many com-\nplications at players, they'll begin to feel like they have less and\nless control over their characters’ lives, and your game may\nbecome frustrating and boring rather than enjoyably complex.\n\nPLOTTING A SHADOWRUN ADVENTURE\n\nWhen plotting a conventional story, a writer looks at the\ngoals of the main characters and then provides obstacles to those\ngoals to create dramatic tension. Shadowrun adventures are plot-\nted in basically the same manner, except that the player charac-\nters serve as the protagonists.\n\nFor this reason, custom-designed adventures can often be\nmore fun than published Shadowrun adventures. A gamemaster\nknows his player characters better than anyone else, and that\nknowledge can enable him to accurately tailor adventures to\nthose player characters and their goals.\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nEvery adventure starts with an idea—a seed from which the\nstory grows. Fortunately, there's no lack of sources for adventure\nideas. Any Shadowrun book—adventure books, sourcebooks and\neven rulebooks—can provide ideas, In fact, certain sourcebooks,\nsuch as Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon, contain adventure\nhooks specifically designed to help gamemasters create adven-\ntures from the material provided in the book. The “black informa-\ntion” posted by shadowrunners in the various books Is especially\nrich with adventure ideas. This black info, posted by members of\nthe shadow community, often describes various hooks, clues,\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion"

        "text": "Set - HA\n<a\n\nThe actors in an adventure can be individuals, small or large\ngroups or organizations, or any combination of the “players” of\nthe Shadowrun universe. An actor may play his part on the stage\nor behind the scenes. Generally, big actors and big adventures go\nhand in hand. For example, a war between local gangs can seem\nfairly routine to some runners. But if the Triads are backing one\ngang and the Mafia is backing the other, a bigger and potentially\nmore dangerous scenario begins to take shape. Now, if that same\nwar takes place near a secret Saeder-Krupp research facility,\nLofwyr himself might take notice and really heat things up.\n\nThe following entries offer a few suggestions for potential\nactors based on descriptions of various individuals, groups and\norganizations in published Shadowrun books, though this list is\nby no means exhaustive. Many Shadowrun sourcebooks also\ninclude descriptions of specific NPCs and organizations, and sug-\ngestions for using them in adventures and campaigns.\n\nCorporations\n\nBig megacorporations such as Ares and Mitsuhama have\nbeen fiercely competing with one another for decades. With the\nrecent rise of mid- and smail-sized corps in the Shadowrun uni-\nverse, business has become more cutthroat than ever.\n\nOrganized Crime\n\nThe Mafia and yakuza come to mind immediately, but don’t\nforget the Triads, Seoulpa Rings, T-bird smugglers and pirates. All\nof these organized crime groups prey on innocent people, not-so-\ninnocent people and on one another. Deadly power struggles are\ncommon between and even within these groups. Any communi-\nty that would be reluctant to take its problems to law enforcement\nmakes a tempting target for organized-crime protection rackets,\nand mobsters continue to control a cornucopia of crime industries,\nranging from smuggling to BTL production to sexual slavery.\n\nCops\n\nLone Star, Knight Errant, Hard Corps, Wolverine, Eagle, Thugs\nwith Guns—who and what do the law-enforcement organizations\nin the Shadowrun universe really serve and protect? Are they\nclean or corrupt? Where clo their jurisdictions end?\n\nLaw-enforcement types share a natural, mutual hostility with\nshadowrunners. and there's no better cover for a racket than a\npolice badge.\n\nGangs\n\nShadowrun gangs run the gamut from mutual-protection\nclubs of friends to groups of street punks who joytoy for money to\nRV-equipped go-gangs that roam the interstate highways to syn-\ndicates of hardened criminals with drugs, guns and connections.\nThere's also the old-fashioned biker gangs that hang in heavy-\nmetal bars and provide security for concerts just to make ends\nmeet, and a hundred other specialty gangs.\n\nMilitary/Para-Military Groups\n\nThe land, sea and air forces of any country possess military\nresources that most corps can’t match, including submarine fleets,\nentire divisions of soldiers, novahot tech toys and major mojo.\n\nNearly every modern military contains air, armor and recon\nbranches, as well as those nifty Special Forces. The Gi Joes and\nJanes of the Sixth World are usually called in to handle seriously\nweird magic situations or unexplained phenomena (such as Bug\nCity), but the militaries of nearly any combination of countries (the\nUte Nation and Tir na nOg, CAS and ... another faction of the CAS)\nmight face off over matters of “vital national interest” in the world\nof Shadowrun.\n\nConflict might also come in the form of the Seattle Metroplex\nGuardsmen and other civil policing groups sworn to control riots\nand otherwise keep order in Seattle.\n\nPoliticians and Policlubs\n\nThe UCAS presidential election of 2057 may be over, but con-\ngressmen are elected every other year. Politics is a dirty business,\nso it's not surprising that shadowruns can become particularly\nmessy when they're politically motivated. City councilmen, mayors.\ngovernors, senators, even folks no one thinks about, such as\nSupreme Court justices and the Surgeon General, may hire shad-\nowrunners to act as bodyguards, gather information on their oppo-\nnents or conduct “dirty tricks” campaigns.\n\nPoliclubs also present a wide range of roleplaying possibili-\nties. Metahuman and human rights, secessionists, abortion, the\ndeath penalty, gun control—name any cause or prejudice you can\nthink of, and the odds are there's a policlub espousing or con-\ndemning It.\n\nInternational Opponents\n\nMegacorporations may have usurped much of the power\nonce wielded by national governments, but that hasn't lowered\nthe stakes of international geopolitics and it hasn't reduced the\nnumber of international spies, wheeler-dealers and terrorists run-\nning around. The CIA, Interpol, the successors of the KGB, the Tir\nPaladins. international fixers, arms dealers and general trouble-\nmaking terrorists are just a few potential international actors that\ncan play a role in an adventure.\n\nMedia Types\n\nMedia types can add a dash of glamour, danger and good\nold-fashioned sex appeal to an adventure. Trid networks, radio,\nsimsense, music, sports and flatscreen movie theaters remain big\nbusiness in the Sixth World. From simple radio interviews to\nDesert Wars, from pirate trideo broadcasts to desperate rockers\nfaking their own deaths, the media types of the Shadowrun world\nwill go to any lengths to boost their ratings and sales. Muckraking\ninvestigative reporting shows, daytime talk shows, combat-game\nshows, professional wrestling, simporn, music trideos—they all\ngenerate billions of nuyen each year, and the assorted stars, has-\nbeens, producers. media conglomerates and organized-crime\ntypes involved in the business fight tooth-and-nail for their share.\n\nShadowrunners and Other Shady Characters\n\nPlayer characters need not be the only shadowrunners involved\nin an adventure.

        "text": "than those that make up gangs. By definition, shadowrunners do\nthe work that no one else can or will do. The profession generally\nattracts the marginal types who just don’t fit in with twenty-first-\ncentury militaries, corporations, organized crime groups and other\n“acceptable” societal norms. Consequently, NPC shadowrunners\nprovide an excellent way for gamemasters to introduce wild, out-\nlandish and colorful characters into adventures. Furthermore, run-\nners are a notoriously competitive bunch, and no one makes a bet-\nter match for a shadowrunner than another runner.\n\nOrdinary People\n\nOrdinary people are the folks you deal with during your “nor-\nmal” daily life—bank employees, the clerks at the Department of\nMotor Vehicles, insurance adjusters, temporary employee ser-\nvices, caterers, janitors, garbage men, telephone solicitors, col-\nlege professors, lawyers, squatters, girlfriends, boyfriends and so\non, All these people have a place in the Shadowrun universe, too.\nWatch television for two hours. Design a run that involves a mem-\nber of a profession portrayed on a program or commercial, or a\nscene that requires runners to put on the hat of an ordinary per-\nson for a little while. Interaction with ordinary people might not\ncreate great drama, but it might generate some light comic relief,\nremind the runners who gets hurt when they act carelessly, devel-\nop new contacts or add a little metahuman interest to an other-\nwise corp-focused story line.\n\nOdds and Ends\n\nThe Shadowrun world offers a mix of science fiction and fan-\ntasy that generates a wide range of individual beings and organi-\nzations unique to the universe (or distinct from similar groups in\nother mythos), such as ancient elves, free spirits, dragons, Things\nMan Was Not Meant to Know, ghosts, vampires, werejaguars and\ninitiatory groups, not to mention whatever's bouncing around in\nthe Matrix. A member of any of these species or groups can serve\nas an actor in a campaign, or gamemasters can create their own\nunique life forms based on these types.\n\nTHE DECISION TREE\n\nPublished Shadowrun adventures use a “decision tree” for-\nmat. Unlike a single, linear plot line, the decision-tree format\ndescribes several courses of action player characters may take. The\nplayers’ decisions, in turn, determine the adventure’s outcome.\nBy using the decision-tree format in your own adventures, you\ncan provide player characters with the same flexibility and deci-\nsion-making power.\n\nStart by thinking of your adventure plot as a flow chart with\ntwo points. Point A represents the beginning of the adventure,\nthe point at which the players become involved. Point B repre-\nsents the end of the adventure, at which the player characters\nachieve the adventure goal. A linear plot would have a single path\nfrom Point A to Point B. In the decision-tree format, however,\nmultiple paths, or “branches,” connect the beginning and end of\nthe adventure.\n\nTo create each different path, simply start at Point A and\nwrite down the possible courses of action the characters might\ntake at that point. For example, if they are meeting with a Mr.\n\nJohnson who offers them a job, they have two obvious choices—\naccept the job or reject it. Depending on the player characters,\nthey might also take other actions, such as starting a fight with the\nJohnson. Once you've determined the character's likely choices,\nstart a plot line for each choice. The next point on Plot Line 1 will\ncover what happens if the runners accept the job offer. The next\npoint on Plot Line 2 will cover what happens if they reject the\noffer. Plot Line 3 would cover what happens if they attack the\nJohnson.\n\nContinue this process at each event in the different plot lines.\nSimply ask yourself, what are the characters likely to do, and what\nwill happen next because of their choice? Make notes about the\nNPC opponents the characters are likely to encounter along each\nplot line, important locations where the action will take place, and\nso on. These notes prepare you to run each encounter as it occurs,\nregardless of the path the characters follow. Be sure to note any\ncomplications you intend to throw at the players (see\nComplications, p. 97, and When the Drek Hits the Fan, below,\nfor more information)\n\nKeep in mind that different plot lines can merge and inter-\nsect. The characters’ decision at one point may lead them back to\nanother plot line, or various plot lines may lead back to one main\nline. Additionally, some scenes in an adventure can be arranged\nso that they can take place in a variety of orders without affect-\ning the overall plot of the adventure. For example, some scenes\nmay simply describe different locations characters can visit while\ndoing legwork; the characters can visit the locations in whatever\norder they choose without changing the effect of the information\nthey discover.\n\nNo matter how many different “branches” you plan for your\ndecision tree, players tend to surprise you with unexpected plans\nthat take them along paths you didn’t predict. In these cases,\nsimply stay flexible and modify your planned material to suit the\nnew direction.\n\nFor examples of the decision-tree format, look at a few pub-\nlished Shadowrun adventures and outline the various plots. You'll\nquickly recognize the different branches of the decision tree used\nin each adventure.\n\nWHEN THE DREK HITS THE FAN\n\nBesides injecting the unpredictability of real life into adven-\ntures, complications make convenient turning points to change\nthe direction of an adventure and keep the player characters from\nproceeding directly to the adventure goal.\n\nUsually two or three major complications are enough to get\nthe adventure off and running. After that, keep an eye out for the\ncomplications that the players themselves will provide for you and\nlearn to use them to your advantage. For example, if one charac-\nter badly fails a Stealth Test and is captured by corp security while\nthe other runners escape, weave that complication into the story.\nWill the corporation get information from the captured runner?\nWhat will it do with that information? Will the captive runner's\ncompanions try to rescue him or hang him out to dry? If they\nabandon him, how will the captured runner react? Even one or\ntwo complications can spawn numerous new plots and subplots.\n\nSee Complications, p, 97. for more information.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPpantian"

They shouldn't simply wait around to offer help\nwhen the player characters need it, Every ally should have his, her\nor its own reasons for helping the player characters. Some might\nhelp the runners out of mutual respect or friendship. Others may\noffer to help for their own selfish reasons—usually because they\nare opposed to the antagonist as well. Still others may help\nbecause the player characters’ success will further their own plots.\nConsequently, characters may want to keep a close eye on their\nallies as well as their enemies—because an ally who is helpful one\nday may abandon or even turn on the players the next day.\n\nThe most fickle ally of any shadowrunner is Fate—also known\nas Lady Luck, Fortune, Chance, kismet and many other names.\nFate provides gamemasters with a convenient way to give player\ncharacters lucky breaks when needed to keep an adventure mov-\ning along. Unfortunately, what Fate giveth, Fate also taketh\naway—runners who benefit from sudden good fortune may run\ninto unexpected complications later on (when such complications\nsuit the gamemaster's plans, of course).\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nOnce the characters achieve the adventure goal or give up\ntrying, it's time to wrap up the adventure. Consider a variety of\nendings for the adventure. Try not to fall in love with one particu-\nlar ending or climatic scene. The decisions of your player charac-\nters are likely to change your plot early in the adventure, and an\nending that doesn’t flow naturally from earlier events will seem\ncontrived. Simply keep the scene in mind in case an opportunity\nto use it arises in another adventure.\n\nThe consequences, or aftermath, of different endings may\nalso affect which ending you choose to present. Events that hap-\npen in one adventure can be used in future games to provide con-\ntinuity and richness to your campaign. Jotting down answers to\nthe following questions is an excellent way to determine likely\ndirections for the aftermath of an adventure:\n\n* Did the players leave any loose ends hanging? If so, would any\nof them be fun to pursue in later adventures?\n\n* Did the runner's actions hurt or anger any NPCs, corporations, or\nother groups (specifically, anyone who might want revenge)?\n\n* Which NPCs and player characters were the major “actors” in the\nstory? Which ones acted memorably?\n\n* Did the runners’ actions attract any media attention? If so, would\nthis attention mark the runners as targets?\n\n+ Did the runners create any Enemies for themselves?\n\n+ Did other parties notice the runners’ actions?\n\n* Did the runners leave evidence behind? If so, how much?\n(Runners may be SINless, but if corporate security forces and\ncops repeatedly find the same unidentified fingerprints and lots\nof shell casings at specific break-ins, they're going to start a file\n\non the people who left those prints and casings.)\n\n* What's the real identity of the Johnson? Have the runners\nworked for him or her before? If so, are the two runs connected\nsomehow? Why is the Johnson interested in the runners? Is\nthere anyone who might pay for a run against this Johnson?\n\n* Is it time to let a player character achieve the personal goal that\nshe's always dreamed of—and will it happen in the way she\nexpected?\n\nPAYMENT AND REWARD\n\nThe end of a successful run means it's time to count the\nnuyen. How much money is an appropriate fee for a team of run-\nners? The gamemaster ultimately decides, based on the risk of the\nrun, the employer's ability and willingness to pay and the runners’\nreputations, but the following guidelines may help set appropri-\nate fees.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that player characters will average about\none shadowrun per month. A good starting point for an individ-\nual runner's payment is one month's living expenses, plus the\ncost of gear needed for the run. If the player characters on the\nteam have different lifestyles, use an average of the characters’\nlifestyle costs to determine their living expenses.\n\nAn occasional big windfall serves as a great campaign tease.\nWindfalls make excellent pay-offs after hard-fought campaigns or\nexcellent stepping stones for new campaigns. Keep windfalls\nrare—they should reflect the difficulty of the campaign that's just\nfinished of the difficulties likely to afflict the upcoming campaign.\nAs a rule of thumb, a windfall should equal roughly 6 months of\nthe character's lifestyle cost. Windfalls always come from unex-\npected sources.\n\nRunner fees and windfalls need not be briefcases filled with\ncredsticks. In fact, alternate payment methods are a great way to\nenable player characters to survive and continue to perform runs\nwithout accumulating fortunes. Instead of nuyen, payment may\ntake the form of valuable data, individuals, equipment, paid\nexpenses, time in a magic-research facility or special Matrix\naccess. SIN numbers also make good alternate payment. as do\nDoc Wagon contracts and cyberware implants. For more ideas,\nlook in the Equipment Tabies at the end of the Shadowrun rule-\nbook or other Shadowrun books. These sections contain numer-\nous items that most characters can’t afford but would willingly\naccept from a grateful Johnson.\n\nDouble all base fees and windfalls if you're running an amoral\ncampaign in which the player characters are more concerned with\nmaking money than doing the right or honorable thing (see\nKarma and the Amoral Campaign, p. 78). Adjust fees and wind-\nfalls to match the needs of your game.\n\nARCHETYPAL ADVENTURE PLOTS\n\nExperienced Shadowrun players may find their characters\ncaught up in certain “classic” adventure plots again and again,\neach time struggling against a different variation on a theme. This\nsection describes several of these archetypal adventure plots and\nProvides ideas for using them as models for your own unique\nadventures.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

Not only that, he wants the runners to let the target\nknow that someone's on to him and to collect hush money from\nthe target. Generally, blackmail jobs require long-term employ-\nment and extra levels of secrecy on the part of the runners.\n\nBODYGUARD\nThe player characters are hired to keep a subject alive or\nundamaged. Variables include:\n+ The subject's lifestyle and heaith\n+ The resources, intentions, knowledge and expertise of his\nwould-be killers\n\nCOURIER/SMUGGLING\nThe team must pick up a message or transport cargo from\none location to another.

Examples include fak-\ning a death, creating a false charity or bank that will attract\ndeposits from a target, falsifying records or “framing” someone\nfor a crime.\n\nINVESTIGATION\nThe runners are hired to gather information on an event or\nperson. Variables include:\n\n* The nature of the information. “Low-stakes” information includes\nevidence for messy divorce cases, missing persons, who was\npresent when a robbery took place and so on. “High-stakes”\ninformation includes photo reconnaissance for a military strike,\npolitical secrets, enough evidence for the police to bust a drug\nring.\n\n+ The means of gathering the information—for example, inter-\nviewing witnesses, infiltrating a weapons-smuggling ring,\nmatrix searches, “test-driving” an experimental combat vehicle\nor weapon system\n\nEXTRACTION (KIDNAPPING)\n\nThe employer wants someone bodily picked up and taken\nsomewhere. This is usually known as an “extraction,” because the\ntarget can be willing or unwilling. Variables include:\n\n+ The target—for example, a dangerous parole violator, simsense\nstarlet, researcher who wants to defect from his corporation,\nornery elephants\n\n+ How long the target must be held—1! day, 3 months and so on\n\n* How the target should be treated—like a queen, don’t break\nmore than two bones and so on\n\n* The size of the target—for example, one individual, a group of\nsix people, all the passengers on an airplane\n\n+ Additional instructions—keep the target captive on his private\ncruise liner, deliver him to another team, brainwash her, execute\nhim, write the ransom note, escort the target to the personnel\ndepartment at Corporation X and so on\n\nPLANT\n\nThe runners are hired to plant an object somewhere. Objects\nmight include electronic listening devices (bugs), remotely con-\ntrolled or timed bombs, microfilm or datafiles for later pick-up,\nand restricted milspec weapons.\n\nRETRIEVAL OF OBJECT\n\nThis is the classic “go get the secret prototype” mission.\nGamemasters can vary it by substituting different items for the\nprototype—a powerful focus or magical weapon, a symbolically\nsignificant item such as the Holy Grail or the sword of the employ-\ner’s grandfather, and so on. Other variables include the security\naround the object and other people intent on “retrlevirig” it for\nthemselves.\n\nSECURITY\nThe employer needs someone to provide security. Variables\ninclude:\n\n* Item/subject to be protected—for example, a ritual magic circle,\nvacuum-sealed vampire, entire rock concert, your fixer during a\nBTL deal, a corporate facility, a storehouse of food\n\n+ Whether or not the runners know the true nature of the item or\nthe real identity of the subject\n\n* Type of security to be provided—physical, magical, Matrix, any\ncombination of those and so on\n\n* Restrictions on the level of force the runners can use. Remember,\ndrunk bar patrons sue, black-ops teams don't.\n\n* The threat from which the team is protecting the item/person—\nfor example, petty criminals, other shadowrunners, heavily\narmed mercenaries, corporate hit teams\n\nTAILCHASER\n\nThis adventure plot creates a specialized sort of double-cross.\nThe employer has two or more goals that the runners may fulfill\neither by succeeding in their task, failing in their task, being cap-\ntured by the opposition, dying in the attempt or participating in\nany number of other outcomes. Whatever the runners accomplish\nor fail to. accomplish provides the employer with a certain amount\nof desired information, and he, she or it walks away from the run\nsatisfied with the results. The primary effect of this type of run is\nto demoralize the player characters—no matter how well or how\npoorly they perform their task, the employer is equally pleased\nwith the outcome, forcing the characters to accept that their\nactions just didn’t matter. This type of adventure can be particu-\nlarly devastating if the team loses a member or two in the course\nof the run.\n\nWAR\n\nThe employer wants a /ot of people hurt, intimidated, ruined\nor killed so they can no longer harm his interests or hinder his\nplans, The runners may start slowly and gradually escalate their\ntactics or simply begin with a full-scale conflict.\n\nWILD THINGS\nThe runners are hired to observe, track, capture and tame, or\nhunt and kill a particular critter or critters.

        "text": "paign and includes suggestions for creating fun and interesting\nstory lines,\n\nPLAYER CHARACTERS\n\nThe player characters themselves are probably the most\nimportant consideration of creating a campaign. because the play-\ner characters’ interests and abilities will determine the most satis-\nfying type of campaign for the group to play. For example, if all\nthe players want to play magician characters, the gamemaster\nshould create a campaign specially tailored to provide plenty of\nopportunities for them to use magic. If the players want to run a\nteam of cyber-solider mercenaries, the gamemaster can go for an\nover-the-top action-oriented campaign. Gamemasters may even\nwish to use one of the specialized alternate campaign types pro-\nvided in Alternate Campaign Concepts (pp. | 10-30) to create a\nchallenging campaign tailored to their players.\n\nIn addition to selecting an appropriate campaign type for the\nplayer group, the gamemaster should try to devise a campaign\nthat provides each individual player character with opportunities\nto use his or her unique abilities and “grab the spotlight.”\n\nCreating the Team's Characters\n\nPlayers have two options when creating a team. They may\ndevelop their characters as a group, or each player may develop\nhis or her character without any input from the other players.\n\nDesigning characters as a group helps ensure that they will\nfit well together as a team. Players can provide their characters\nwith common Enemies, give them previous adventures together\nor connect them to each other with ties of friendship or blood. By\nworking together, players can ensure that their characters repre-\nsent a variety of different specialties and abilities, enhancing the\nversatility of the group as a whole and reducing the number of\ncharacters possessing similar skills and abilities. Designing char-\nacters as a group also enables the gamemaster to tailor his\nadventures and campaigns to the skills of the characters more\neasily and provide enough situations for all of the characters to\nget in on the action.\n\nCreating characters as a group, however, also takes away the\nelement of surprise that adds to the fun of discovering things\nabout your teammates, By designing their characters without\ninput from the rest of the group, players can give their characters\nbackground, contacts, Edges and Flaws and abilities that they\nkeep secret from their teammates. Such secrets can serve as\njumping-off points for unexpected events and opportunities for\nroleplaying. The drawback to individual character generation Is\nthat it may produce ill-matched or unevenly balanced teams.\nWhen team members have little in common, simply getting along\nwith one another can become an adventure in itself for the player\ncharacters.\n\nAssembling the Team\n\nThe gamemaster can assemble the individual player charac-\nters into a team in a variety of ways. Providing the player charac-\nters with a common contact (fixer, Mr. johnson, Mob boss and so\non) is probably the easiest way. In this case, the contact has a job\nthat requires the specific skills of each character.\n\nGiving the team members a common purpose may produce\nthe most cohesive group. The common interest may be as sim-\nple as staying alive and making a fast nuyen on the mean streets\nof the Sixth World or something more involved. Generally, the\nmore invested each character is in the common purpose, the\nmore likely the runners are to work together, though that does-\nn't mean that the characters have to like one another, The\nShadowrun universe contains plenty of individuals who don't\nlike each other but are willing to put aside their mutual dislike to\nachieve a common goal.\n\nDefending against a common Enemy or opponent offers one\nexample of a common purpose. In this example, if time allows,\nthe gamemaster can even run a few preliminary mini-adventures\nwith one or two player characters at a time to introduce or fore-\nshadow the Enemy's interest in each character.\n\nFostering Team Spirit\n\nAssembling a team is only one of the challenges facing a\ngamemaster and his or her players. Keeping a team together can\nprove even more difficult.\n\nBoth players and gamemasters share a responsibility to toler-\nate one another and find ways for their characters to work togeth-\ner as teams, but gamemasters have the greatest stake in keeping\nthings together—simply because gamemasters spend so much\ntime preparing adventures and campaigns.\n\nAssembling a group of players who get along in real life is a\nsimple way to increase the chances that the player's characters\nwill get along in the fictional universe. However, the power to roll\ndice and tell someone you've killed their character can produce\ntensions between even the best friends.\n\nGamemasters can promote “team spirit” among characters\nby emphasizing the characters’ non-business relationships.\nCharacters that hang out and relax with one another are more like-\nly to work out their disagreements peacefully than characters who\nare mere business acquaintances, because roleplaying non-busi-\nness time gives characters chances to learn about one another. For\nexample, the appearance of a new troll teammate who went\nberserk and killed every single person in the Aztechnology build-\ning might prompt characters to call the cyber-psycho squad.\nHowever, those same characters might have a different view of\ntheir new teammate when they learn that Azzie goons killed the\ntroll's sister first-—and in a particularly unpleasant fashion.\n\nIsolating a team of characters from the rest of the world can\nalso help foster team spirit. Isolating a team forces the members to\ndepend on and trust one another. for example, if you dump a\nSeattle-based team in the middle of the Mojave Desert or drop a\nteam of human runners into the Ork Underground, they will need\nto rely on each other simply because they won't be able to trust\nanyone else. Even the simple act of putting street runners into unfa-\nmiliar corporate territory can encourage them to work together.\n\nA common Enemy or opponent—an individual, group or\nentity that the characters can defeat only by banding together—\nmay also force characters to work together and foster team spirit,\nRunning a. game session only when all the players are present may\nalso promote team spirit. If characters are always hired as a unit,\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion\n\n(04"

Conversely, if new characters are\nconstantly coming and going, the player characters may view\nthemselves more as individuals than as a team.\n\nFinally, listen to your players and try to give them what they\nwant. Players who are happy with the game and their characters\nare more tolerant of their fellow players’ idiosyncrasies and mis-\ntakes than players who are unhappy with a game. Similarly, every-\none enjoys a chance to play the hero every now and then, so give\neach player character opportunities to do so. This will reduce jeal-\nousy and rivalries among player characters and make player char-\nacters more supportive of one another.\n\nTeam Tensions\n\nWhile playing together as a cohesive, trusting team offers\nmany advantages, occasional tensions and suspicions among\nteammates can provide great roleplaying opportunities. Team\ntensions can inspire impassioned arguments and conversations\namong characters and memorable nights of roleplaying for play-\ners. For the sake of enjoyable gaming, however, it's probably best\nto develop players’ team spirit and group cohesion before intro-\nducing team tensions. A group consisting of five ork street sams\nand a Humanis decker is likely to lead to a quick fight and a dead\ncharacter. But characters who learn that the new teammate who\nsaved their lives last night is a former terrorist may be willing to\nget along despite deeply felt, contrasting beliefs.\n\nKeep in mind that some issues are more volatile than others.\nCharacters who might forgive a new teammate’s questionable\npast may not be willing to accept a racist character or one who\nacts specifically against them.\n\nTHEMES\n\nThe overall themes of a campaign may determine the direc-\ntion and tone of the campaign as well as specific adventure plots.\nFor example, adventures for a campaign based on themes of\nrevenge will be quite different than adventures for a campaign\nbased on themes of greed.\n\nOther themes include heroism, redemption, fighting the\ngood fight, and simply making as much money as possible with-\nout getting caught, improving the living conditions of a neigh-\nborhood, protecting children, wiping out prejudice, wiping out\nanother race, saving or destroying the earth and so on.\n\nCertain themes may also provide common purposes for\ngroups of player characters. For example, characters in a revenge-\nthemed campaign may want to settle a score with a common\nenemy. Characters in a redemption-themed campaign might join\ntogether to perform a mission to redeem themselves or others.\n\nMORALITY\n\nPlayers and gamemasters should also consider the moral tone\nof their campaigns. Are the player characters heartless mercenar-\nies who would do anything for nuyen, or are they knights in shin-\ning chrome and leather? Most characters fall somewhere in\nbetween, but gamemasters and their players may still want to\nestablish some campaign ground rules beforehand. These types of\nground rules will let players know what is expected of their char-\nacters and prevent unpleasant surprises later in the game.\n\nSome groups prefer principled characters who avoid unnec-\nessary violence and killing. Other groups prefer plenty of combat\nand have no problem with geeking any opponents who come\nalong, as long as the money is right. The Shadowrun universe has\nroom for both types of players and everyone in between. Each\nplayer group must decide for itself what kind of team it wants to\n\nplay.\n\nSCOPE\n\nIn a roleplaying adventure, the player characters are always\nat the center of the story. The scope of a campaign is simply how\nfar out from that center the characters’ story extends. How much\nimpact will the characters’ actions have on the rest of the world?\nAre they just cogs in the big machine of the metroplex, unable to\nreally change the way things are, or are they visionaries with the\npower and influence to shape the fate of nations? The scope of the\ncampaign can determine its stability and direction, as well as how\nit will change and grow over time.\n\nCampaigns with limited scopes are usually best for beginners,\nbecause attempting to comprehend and react to all of the events\nof the Shadowrun universe can be quite daunting. A small scale\nalso allows the gamemaster to control the campaign more easily,\nthough it limits the players’ options a bit as well.\n\nMore experienced players may find small-scale campaigns\ntoo confining, while others find them very comfortable. The play-\ners of an individual group should decide if they prefer to move on\nto larger-scale adventures. Players should also consider their rela-\ntive skill, ability and power levels when selecting the scope of\ntheir campaign. Characters who aren't capable of tackling world-\nclass threats may want to stick to small-scale campaigns lest they\nfind themselves hopelessly outclassed. On the other hand, a glob-\nal-scale campaign may present the ideal challenge for experi-\nenced runners who want to topple or protect governments,\nmegacorps or other powerful and influential figures—and are\nready to take on very powerful opponents.\n\nLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION\n\nThe Sixth World offers a broad range of adventure settings,\nfrom urban sprawls to Awakened wilderness areas. Gamemasters\nshould consider the settings that will be used in a campaign while\nplanning the campaign, because the choice of settings can have a\ngreat impact on the story. Gamemasters should ask themselves\nquestions such as: Will a campaign's adventures take place in a\nspecific metroplex or nation? Which locales will the characters fre-\nquent? Which corporations have the most influence in those\nplaces? What is the local shadow-community like? What are the\nlocal laws?\n\nWhen planning campaign settings, gamemasters should\navoid the common temptation to send their players bouncing all\nover the globe during a single campaign (unless, of course, the\nplayers’ group is a jet-setting, globe-hopping team of high-priced\nrunners). In many cases, players in globe-hopping campaigns start\nfeeling that nothing in the campaign is permanent or important.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "THE FIRST RUN\n\nThe first run of any campaign is very important, because it\nsets the tone of the campaign to follow and establishes the over-\nall themes and premises of the campaign. Like the first line in a\nshort story or the first scene in a movie, the first run of a campaign\nmust grab the players’ attention or they may soon lose interest in\nthe game. Additionally, it should “hook” the player characters\nwithout overwhelming them; it should provide the basis for spin-\noff adventures and encourage the players to continue pursuing a\ncampaign. It should provide time for the different characters to\ndevelop without becoming overly long or boring. It should reveal\nenough to keep the players involved without giving away too\nmany mysteries.\n\nPerhaps the best way to ensure that a first run does all these\nthings is to incorporate into the first adventure the various ele-\nments discussed in this section—opportunities for each player\ncharacter to shine, an exciting and climactic plot, an external\nthreat that brings the players together as a team, and so on.\n\nCHARACTER ADVANCEMENT\n\nGamemasters can control the speed of character advance-\nment In their campaigns by adjusting the size of Karma awards for\nadventures, providing opportunities for the characters to use their\naccumulated Karma, controlling payment for runs and adjusting\nthe runners’ expenses as necessary. Larger Karma awards enable\nplayer characters to advance and gain power quickly, while small-\ner Karma awards slow character advancement, Similarly, higher\nfees for runs will generally enable players to buy more equipment,\nthough gamemasters can exert control over player characters’\nwealth by raising or lowering their expenses.\n\nFor more information on handling Karma and character\nadvancement, see the Advanced Rules section, p. 76.\n\nKEEPING IT FRESH\n\nOver time, any extended campaign may become a bit stale.\nHowever, inventive gamemasters and creative players can take\nseveral steps to revitalize campaigns and keep them fresh and\ninteresting.\n\nSimply taking a break from the campaign and setting it aside\nfor a time may be enough to rejuvenate a campaign. A break\ngives the gamemaster's and the players’ creative “batteries” time\nto recharge and may inspire renewed interest when the\ngamemaster and players return to the campaign. Every group\nmust determine the appropriate length for a break. Some groups\nmay find that a few weeks is enough, while other groups may\nwant to take a few months off.\n\nAlternatively, an ongoing campaign might need something\nto shake it up a bit and get things moving again, The gamemas-\nter might want to change the campaign's theme or focus to help\nbreathe new life into the story and the characters. For example,\none Shadowrun campaign that had been running for several years\nhad reached a point where the player characters were highly\ncapable shadowrunners with extensive backgrounds, resources\nand abilities. The players no longer found the “typical” shad-\nowruns challenging or interesting, and they had begun to grow\ntired of their characters. To shake things up, the gamemaster set\n\nup a new series of adventures in which the player characters were\nframed for the murder of an important political figure and sent to a\nUCAS federal prison. An influential fixer sprang the shadowrunners\nfrom prison within a relatively short period, but during their jail time\nthe runners lost most of their contacts and resources, and their rep-\nutations took a serious beating. The characters found themselves on\nthe streets with little more than the clothes on their backs, in debt\nto a mysterious fixer and looking to clear their names and avenge\nthemselves against the people who framed them. The campaign\nwas off and running again.\n\nThe Bug City, Super Tuesday, Shadows of the Underworld,\nPortfolio of a Dragon, and Threats books all offer plentiful twists\nthat can help change the direction of a campaign and spark new\ninterest among players.\n\nBLUEBOOKING\n\n“Bluebooking” is an excellent roleplaying and story-develop-\nment tool for campaigns.\n\nPlayers who use a bluebook simply keep records of their char-\nacters in notebooks, A character's bluebook is like a diary—it can\ninclude everything from personal recollections to private conversa-\ntions between characters. They can be used to record character sto-\nries and background and between-adventure activities.\n\nUsing bluebooking to record private conversations between char-\nacters or between characters and gamemasters enables characters and\ngamemasters to keep secrets from other players, This use makes blue-\nbooking an ideal tool to inject paranoia, conspiracies, or simply a bit\nof mystery into a game. To use bluebooking for secrets, a character\nsimply writes down the secret message or information in his note-\nbook, then shows the notebook to the gamemaster or the character\nwith whom he wants to share the secret.\n\nGamemasters should carefully control bluebooking in their\ngames, however, because players may begin to conduct nearly all of\ntheir interactions by bluebooking (which is not necessarily a bad\nthing, as long as it’s intentional) and abandon active roleplaying.\n\nENDING THE CAMPAIGN\n\nGamemasters can devise dramatic, “blaze-of-glory” endings for\ncampaigns or simply allow their player characters go their separate\nways and break up the team. In either case, the events and fallout of\nthe old campaign can be used as source material for a new cam-\npaign. Friends and foes alike can resurface in the new campaign,\nalong with unfinished business or other loose ends. If. for any rea-\nson, the players are no longer interested in playing their characters\nat the end of a campaign, that need not spell the end of the player\ncharacters, See Retirement, p. 87 for suggestions on using old char-\nacters in continuing games.\n\nSOLUTIONS TO COMMON PROBLEMS\n\nMost experienced gamemasters face the following common\nchallenges when gamemastering Shadowrun (and other) games\nand campaigns;\n\n* controlling “power-gamers,” players who create super-characters\nso powerful that they dominate the game\n\n* maintaining overall game balance\n\n+ satisfactorily involving deckers and other unique character types in\ngames\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "belle te\n\n+”\nvs\n\nRU ning TH\n\n+ effectively using the overwhelming amount of Shadowrun infor-\nmation available\nThis section offers advice on dealing with these difficult situ-\nations.\n\nPOWER-GAMING\n\nPower-gamers, sometimes (unkindly) referred to as\n“munchkins” or “Monty Haulers,” are players who create “super-\ncharacters\"—magicians with Initiate grade ratings in the double\ndigits and truckloads of foci and bound spirits, street sammies\nwith so much cyberware they become virtual walking tanks, deck-\ners with Computer Skills of 12 and cyberdecks that make the\nFairlight Excalibur look like an abacus and so on.\n\nWell, there’s nothing wrong with power-gaming, (Despite\npersistent rumors, FASA does not maintain a cadre of game police\nready to kick your door in, confiscate your rulebook and drag you\nbefore the game Inquisition for violating the unwritten laws of\nShadowrun. Well, actually there are game police—but they're too\nbusy checking on BattleTech and Earthdawn rules violators to\nbother with Shadowrun groups.) Seriously, FASA couldn't be\nmore pleased to hear that you're enjoying Shadowrun, no matter\nhow you play it.\n\nHowever, if power-gaming starts killing the fun in your game,\nthen it's a problem. Generally, such discrepancies can be avoided\nby meeting with your players and deciding on the general power\nlevels you want in your campaign before you start —a low-pow-\nered “street-level” campaign versus a wild and wahoo power-\ngame of super-characters, for example. Even conscientious plan-\nning may not prevent a player character from amassing a super-\nhuman power level that begins to spoil the fun for everyone else.\nGamemasters may use the strategies described in Obnoxious\nCharacters to control such players.\n\nOBNOXIOUS CHARACTERS\n\nSometimes, players and/or their characters simply get out of\nline and begin spoiling the group's fun. Players can be quite cre-\native when it comes to spoiling a game—some may simply cre-\nate characters that overpower everyone and everything else in the\ngame, while others may insist on following their characters’ own\nwacky plans or their own interpretations of the rules, regardless of\ntheir fellow players’ wishes. The simplest way to deal with such a\ncharacter is to kill him or her—the character, not the player, of\ncourse. However, Shadowrun provides gamemasters with a vari-\nety of other, less-drastic ways to control such players.\n\nReason with the Player\n\nTake the problem player aside and talk to him. Tell him that\nhe's creating a problem and how you think the problem can be\nfixed. Reasoning with a problem player is always better than sim-\nply punishing the player's character. The player may not under-\nstand why his character is catching the drek or may decide that\nthe gamemaster is picking on his character for no reason.\n\nIf the player is not willing to change his or her behavior for\nthe benefit of the group, then it may be time for the player and\nthe group to part ways. If reasoning with the player fails. most of\nthe other measures described here won't work much better.\n\nPut the Character in Jail\n\nA stint in one of the prisons run by Lone Star or the govern-\nment can go a long way toward improving a character's attitude.\nIf the character is SINless and lacks powerful connections, the\nauthorities may even want to try some experimental new “reha-\nbilitation” techniques on the character.\n\nRuin His/Her Reputation\n\nReputation is everything in the shadows. A character who\ndevelops a reputation as a troublemaker and unreliable or uncon-\ntrollable on runs will eventually run out of people willing to work\nwith him or her. Such characters must shape up and take a few\nlow-paying, hazardous runs to rebuild their reps—or find them-\nselves sliding right to the bottom of the shaclow food-chain to get\nchewed up.\n\nGive Him/Her Bad Karma\n\nKarma is a useful gamemaster tool for rewarding characters\nwho have done well in an adventure. Similarly, gamemasters can\npunish troublesome player characters by penalizing them via\nKarma Points. Penalized characters will have to shape up if they\never want a chance of advancement in the future.\n\nTake It Out on His/Her Contacts\n\nCharacters who frag off the wrong people may find that those\npeople decide to take out their anger on the character's friends,\ncontacts and even loved ones. Contacts are not going to contin-\nue to work with a character who spells such trouble, and any char-\nacter with a shred of conscience should feel badly about bringing\ntrouble down on their friends and loved ones.\n\nTake Away His/Her Toys\n\nIf a character's main problem is too many toys—cyber or\nmagical—the gamemaster can always take a few away.\nGamemasters can relieve characters of excess cyberware or mag-\nical gear in a number of ways. For example, certain authorities\nmight confiscate equipment—especially if the character is impris-\noned. Alternatively, items can be stolen, disabled or simply suf-\nfer system failures. A character's Enemies may also destroy the\ncharacter's assets to deprive him or her of the advantages they\nprovide.\n\nGive ‘em What They Want\n\nIf a character really wants an outlandish advantage or toy, let\nhim or her have it—along with all of the trouble that comes with\nowning it. Characters with exotic gear and other powerful advan-\ntages tend to attract powerful enemies. Additionally, a powerful\nitem or advantage can attract a continual stream of thieves,\nambushes and saboteurs, hopefully creating more trouble than\nthe item or advantage is worth.\n\nMAINTAINING GAME BALANCE\n\nMaintaining a balance between the power of player charac-\nters and their NPC opponents is one of the most important tasks\nof the gamemaster. By keeping the NPC opponents slightly more\npowerful than the player characters, the gamemaster forces the\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanton"

        "text": "player characters to rely on their brains and teamwork, rather than\nsimple firepower, to prevail. On the surface, maintaining such bal-\nance seems simple enough. However, the whole purpose of main-\ntaining game balance is to keep play as fun as possibie.\nConsequently, the gamemaster must strive to maintain game bal-\nance in ways that don’t reduce the fun of the game. In other\nwords, the gamemaster shouldn't sacrifice the players’ freedom\nto use all the cool weapons and spells available in Shadowrun and\nalso shouldn't simply create overpowering opponents whenever\nit's convenient. Maintaining game balance and fun in a game\nrequires some thought on the gamemaster’s part, but under-\nstanding a few basic principles can make it an easier, more\nrewarding task.\n\nPower Is Relative\n\nThe first principle to remember is that game balance is deter-\nmined by the power of the player characters and the power of\ntheir NPC opponents—not the power of one side alone. Instead of\ndenying your players a minigun for their starting characters, sim-\nply remind them that their opposition will also have miniguns—\nand the enemy will probably have a slightly better version. The\nplayer characters’ opponents need not be so totally overpowering\nthat the runners never have a chance, They just need to be strong\nenough to keep the player characters from easily defeating them.\nAs long as the opponents always challenge the runners, your\nplayers eventually will realize that no matter how strong their\ncharacters become, there will always be somebody bigger and\nbadder, someone with a bigger budget, better tech toys, older\nand more experienced, with greater magical training and experi-\nence—someone they can't defeat in a straight-up fight.\n\nFirepower Is Not Everything\n\nIncreasing the strength of NPC opponents is not the only way\nto maintain game balance against power-hungry player groups\nwhose strength continues to grow. With a little imagination,\ngamemasters can devise shadowruns and opponents that can’t be\ndefeated using little more than firepower and combat spells—situ-\nations that force the player characters to use brains and teamwork.\n\nFor example, a Johnson might hire a team of runners for a run\nwhere secrecy is of the utmost importance, a run that no one must\never know about. Obviously, the team can't simply blow away\nanyone and anything in its path—that would draw too much\nattention. They'll have to come up with a strategy that gets them\nto their goal with a minimum of fuss and muss.\n\nKeep “Gamebreakers” Rare\n\n“Gamebreakers” are pieces of equipment, spells, or other\nitems that can destroy game balance and “break” a game. What\nconstitutes a gamebreaker varies depending on the power levels\nof a game or campaign. For example, even a submachine gun\nmight be a gamebreaker in a campaign full of gang members\narmed with light pistols and baseball bats. The same gun would\nbe no big deal in a campaign full of folks packing assault rifles,\nheavy machine guns and other heavy-duty goodies.\n\nKeeping potential gamebreakers rare is the most effective\nway to prevent such elements from ruining a game.\n\nFor example, consider the Panther assault cannon. The can-\nnon's basic cost is a mere 7,200 nuyen, so most starting charac-\nters can buy a case of them—one for the den, the car, the bed-\nroom and so on. Sounds like a game-balance disaster waiting to\nhappen, neh? But let's just say that the Panther is rare—not just\n“no-starting-character-can-have-it” rare, but “no-one-has-seen-\none-or-really-knows-about-it” rare. Contacts scoff if you mention\nthe “magic gun,” the so-called “Holy Grail of the street.”\n\nSuddenly, the “gamebreaker” no longer threatens game bal-\nance. Runners will have a hard time locating one. And if they do,\neveryone's certainly going to notice them. In fact, people will be\nscreaming and running away or trying to cack them from behind\nand steal the thing.\n\nSo by making the Panther rare, rather than forbidding the\nplayers from obtaining one, the gamemaster has not restricted\ntheir freedom. He hasn't reduced the “coolness” factor of the\nweapon—tt will still blow a hole through that Azzie hitman’s\nheavy body armor (as well as her body, the car parked behind her,\nand the brick wall behind the car). He hasn't made the weapon\ncommonplace by equipping all the Lone Star cops with Panthers\nto keep things even. But he’s maintained game balance.\n\nINCORPORATING DECKERS\n\nEvery Shadowrun group has probably experienced it at some\ntime. The decker goes off to do something in cyberspace and the\nrest of the players go out for pizza or play a video game or simply\nsit and chat while the gamemaster and the decker's player do their\nthing. Though the new Matrix rules in Virtual Realities 2.0 speed\nup decking in the game, they do not entirely solve the problem of\nhandling decker characters during the game. The following options\nsuggest ways to better integrate decking with the rest of the action\nin a game and keep it from slowing things down.\n\nNPC Deckers\n\nNPC deckers enable gamemasters to dole out information for\na fee as needed. A gamemaster can quickly determine the results\nof an NPC decker's Matrix run and report that information back to\nthe player characters. NPC deckers give gamemasters a great deal\nof control over the information players acquire and greatly speed\nthings up, but they also greatly reduce the game opportunities\nprovided by the Matrix.\n\nTwo-Pronged Attack\n\nIn a two-pronged attack, the gamemaster plots two simulta-\nneous shadowruns in which the decker goes online and works\n“behind the scenes” to disable security measures and monitor the\nprogress of the run itself while the other characters do the physi-\ncal work of the run, Published Shadowrun adventures and fiction\ncontain numerous examples of such runs.\n\nSimultaneous Gamemastering\n\nUnder the simultaneous gamemastering approach, the\ngamemaster works with the decker to play out the Matrix run and\nguides the other characters through their own activities at the\nsame time. The gamemaster must switch between scenes quickly\nenough to keep all the action moving, maintain dramatic tension\n\nSHADOWRUN COMPANION"

        "text": "RUNNING THE |\n\nand keep the players busy, but this difficult task can be accom-\nplished successfully with plenty of advance preparation.\n\nAssistant Gamemaster\n\nThe gamemaster may also choose to appoint a player to be\nthe assistant gamemaster with the primary task of handling Matrix\ntuns with the decker's player. This arrangement frees the\ngamemaster to devote his full attention to play with the rest of the\ngroup. This approach requires some coordination between the\ngamemaster and his assistant, but it works well for data runs that\nare not directly connected with the action that the other charac-\nters are experiencing.\n\nSolo Matrix Adventures\n\nGamemasters can conduct some Matrix runs as short solo\nadventures for their decker characters before the main game ses-\nsion starts. In this case, the gamemaster simply uses the results\nfrom those Matrix runs as they are needed during the main game.\nThis approach greatly speeds up play but may reduce the amount\nof continuity between Matrix action and the rest of the game. For\nexample, a decker might learn something during the main game\nsession that would have affected his Matrix run that evening.\n\nComputer Skill Test\n\nIn some cases, gamemasters can represent a Matrix run with\na single Computer Skill Test, modified by the effects of the deck-\ners applicable programs. Gamemasters should use this option\nsparingly, if possible, A player may become bored quite quickly if\nhis decker character never does anything other than make\nComputer Tests.\n\nAVOIDING INFORMATION OVERLOAD\n\nEach new Shadowrun book that hits the shelves adds to the\nvast amount of Shadowrun information already available.\nUnderstandably, gamemasters and players often want to incorpo-\nrate as much of this information as possible into their version of\nthe game, which can lead to “information overload” and bog\ndown play. Gamemasters and players simply may need to find a\nway to narrow their focus and incorporate only the information\nimportant to their campaigns at any given time. The following\nsuggestions are designed to aid this process.\n\nLatest-and-Greatest Syndrome\n\nThe Sixth World is an incredibly rich setting that becomes rich-\ner with each successive Shadowrun book. Naturally, many\ngamemasters and players want to use every new rule, weapon,\nspell, opponent, setting or idea that comes along. However, doing\nso can quickly turn a campaign into a long string of tricks, gim-\nmicks and unconnected plots that don't really hold together.\nFortunately, gamemasters can avoid this pitfall and still satisfy their\nplayers’ and their own appetites for new ideas by simply exercis-\ning some patience and doing a little creative gamemastering.\n\nPerhaps most important, gamemasters should consider care-\nfully the appropriateness of any new idea based on the scope of\ntheir campaign, their players’ abilities, and the likely effects of the\nnew idea on their games. Not all options are well-suited for all\n\ncampaigns. Depending on the current direction. power level and\nstory line of his or her campaign, a gamemaster may want to\nmodify or even prohibit certain options. Remember, just because\nan option has appeared in a FASA-published book does not mean\nthat the gamemaster has to allow it into his individual campaign.\nAll of the material in Shadowrun books, including the Shadowrun\nCompanion, are options for gamemasters—not required ele-\nments that gamemasters must use.\n\nRather than modifying or prohibiting new options, gamemas-\nters may incorporate new material into their campaigns gradually.\nFor example, revolutions in bioware. cybertechnology or magical\nresearch shouldn't happen overnight. Gradually adding innova-\ntions from sourcebooks such as the Grimoire, Shadowtech,\nCybertechnology, Virtual Realities 2.0 and Awakenings not only\nmimics the dispersal of technological innovations in the real\nworld—it provides the players and gamemasters time to adjust to\nthe new options. Additionally, gamemasters may prohibit starting\ncharacters from using such options. This provicies the gamemas-\nter with greater control over the use of a new option.\n\nTHE SECRETS OF FASA\n\nOccasionally, Shadowrun players and gamemasters com-\nplain that they just aren't getting the whole story behind every\nnew development in the Shadowrun universe. Well, it’s true\nFASA does have some secrets. But we have good reasons for\nkeeping those secrets.\n\nOur continuing effort to keep the Shadowrun universe vital\nand growing is the main reason for keeping some things to our-\nselves. To keep things fresh, we need to put out new material all\nthe time. Consequently, we have to hold some ideas back to\ndevelop for future products. Additionally, we have to make sure\nthat each new idea fits with the existing universe. And finally, new\noptions—and your reaction to them—have a way of suggesting\neven more directions for the universe. Given these factors, we\nsimply cannot fully describe every nook and cranny or complete-\nly explore every new direction in the game universe. That's why\nno one will ever know everything about the continuing\nShadowrun saga.\n\nOf course, this situation need not stop gamemasters from\ncreating their own unique twists on elements of the Sixth World.\nHave a great plot line about the truth behind the Lone Eagle inci-\ndent or the Crash of '29? Feel free to elaborate on it and use it in\nyour campaign. If it clashes with something published by FASA at\na later date, simply adjust the campaign or ignore the FASA con-\ncept or find a way to make the two stories meet somewhere in\nbetween. We feel fairly confident, however, that FASA's story lines\nand the story lines of Shadowrun gaming groups will rarely over-\nlap in an inconvenient way. For example, sourcebooks such as\nPortfolio of a Dragon provide a multitude of adventure and cam-\npaign plot hooks, and only a few of them will be explored in\nfuture Shadowrun books—leaving plenty of room for gamemas-\nters to play with the possibilities of the universe without worrying\nabout FASA stepping on their toes.\n\nDon't limit the possibilities of your Shadowrun world by\nhedging your bets against FASA’s version of the universe,\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "ANATE CAMPAIGN CONCEP\n\nhe world of Shadowrun is rich and varied, but most players never get to see more than its\ngrimy underbelly. Spending all their time doing the corps’ dirty work and trying to survive\non the mean streets, typical shadowrunners never get more than a glimpse of the larger\nworld they inhabit. Gamemasters who want to explore other aspects of the Shadowrun\nuniverse, or players who simply want a change of pace, might consider running game ses-\nsions or even campaigns in which the characters are something other than shadowrunners.\n\nThese alternate campaigns follow pretty much the same rules as the Shadowrun you\nknow and love, with a few changes that reflect the different situations player characters\nwill face as cops, gang members and so on. This section briefly describes several non-run-\nner campaign concepts, each outlined in the terms given in Keys to a Good Adventure,\np. 96. This material offers the gamemaster springboards for building new campaigns based on any\none of these themes, using the techniques outlined in this book. Though many of these concepts\ntake the campaign beyond the “shadowrunner team” and into other areas of the Sixth World, all\nof them still focus on the unique blend of science fiction and fantasy elements that make\nShadowrun exciting.\n\nWHERE DOES IT HURT?\n\nAltruistic-minded players might want to try playing a DocWagon High Threat Response team.\nJust think: all the dangers of shadowrunning, a regular salary and your own VTOL! This type of\ncampaign may appeal to players who want loads of action without a lot of setup—HIR teams only\nget called in when the action is hot and heavy. Of course, there's a lot more to being a DocWagon\ntech than pulling people out of dangerous situations—just watch any TV hospital drama for a\nwhole host of ideas.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPannion \\0"

        "text": "——\n——\n\nIn\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nCreate DocWagon PCs using standard Shadowrun rules, plus\nthe following guidelines as appropriate. The team should consist\nof a rigger (to drive the ambulance, MedEvac chopper or other\nappropriate vehicle); a mage or shaman for magical healing and\nfire support (note that HTR shamans tend to be followers of Bear\nand Snake because of the healing bonuses conferred by those\ntotems); one or two medical specialists who do most of the actu-\nal patching-up of victims; and additional fire support personnel\n(anything from physical adepts to troll muscle to heavily cybered\ncombat specialists). Deckers don’t usually come along for the ride;\nthey stay at the local headquarters and keep track of all the tacti-\ncal information, as well as notifying local police, governments,\nbusinesses and other services of what's going down. Other types\nof characters with no knack for medicine or defensive combat will\nhave little place in this kind of campaign.\n\nThe gamemaster may rule that no DocWagon characters can\ntake Tech as Priority A or B during character creation, as DocWagon\nwill supply most of the team's non-implanted equipment. (Besides,\nanyone who can afford that kind of gear must be making a lot more\nthan DocWagon pays!) Each character should have a minimum\nBiotech Skill Rating of 3; medical specialists should also have some\n\nMPAIGN CONCEPTS\n\nbiology and/or cybertechnology\nskills. Because HTR teams respond to\nhigh-threat situations, combat skills\nwill also be useful, though the team\nshould be concerned about saving\npatient first and\nkicking hoop second.\n\ndetails about\nDocWagon HTR teams and their\nequipment, see pp. 95-101 of The\nNeo-Anarchist's Guide to Real Life.\n\nthe custom—um.\n\nFor more\n\nADVENTURE IDEAS\n\nThe daily duties of a DocWagon\nHTR team involve rescuing badly\ninjured DocWagon customers from\nsituations too dangerous for normal\nmedical teams. One obvious exam-\nple is a firefight, wherein an inno-\ncent bystander or even a participant\nwith a DocWagon contract gets hit\nand needs attention, Charging into a\ngun battle is a dangerous proposi\ntion, particularly when Lone Star or\nheavily armed shaclowrunners get\ninvolved, or when participants in\nthe fight might not want to see a\nparticular victim survive. In addition,\nthe gamemaster has\nways of making things even more\ninteresting for the players. What if\nthe DocWagon customer is a shad-\nowrunner, and the rest of his team\ncarries him along as they flee the\nscene or continue with their run?\nThe HTR team is contractually obligated to help their customer,\nand so may follow along and get mixed up in all kinds of shad-\n\nnumerous\n\nowrunning mayhem.\n\nGun battles are not the only source of serious injury. Natural\ndisasters, terrorist activity, paranormal animal attacks—all of these\nsituations are prime candidates for an HTR team, and may put the\nmedics in as much danger as the patient. These types of scenar-\nios, where numerous lives are endangered, can also be used to\ntweak the characters’ consciences. If a terrorist bomb wounds fifty\npeople and only three are DocWagon customers, will the charac-\nters be able to make themselves ignore the other wounded while\nperforming their duties? Where does an employment contract\ngive way to conscience?\n\nThe HTR team’s job will be complicated by the fact that they\nare carrying huge amounts of drugs and extremely expensive\nmedical equipment, not to mention firearms, all of which makes\nthem prime targets for thieves. Particularly daring thieves have\nbeen known to injure a DocWagon customer and then lay an\nambush for the HTR team. Though HTR teams are better equipped\nto deal with such situations than the average paramedic squad,\nthey are by no means immune to disaster.\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeantion\n\nIe"

        "text": "* o\nALTE s\nA Yreox\n\nFinally, DocWagon player characters may well have to deal\nwith the problem of competing medical organizations. DocWagon\nis the largest company of its kind, but by no means the only one,\nand many smaller medical companies will try just about anything\nto preserve their market share—including, attacking DocWagon\nteams if both companies respond to calls in the same area.\nTheoretically, the first priority of DocWagon personnel is to insure\ntheir customers’ safety and health. But many DocWagon teams—\nespecially HTR teams—are more than willing to engage in “active\ndefense” against rival companies. As the legendary DocWagon\nHTR pilot Jim “Doc Croc” Crocker once put it, “The Hippocratic\noath don't apply to the competition.”\n\nCAMPAIGNING WITH DOCWAGON\n\nThe following section complements the Archetypal\nAdventure Plots section, p. 10! of Running the Game, by flesh-\ning out some of the concepts presented in that section.\n\nThe Premise\n\nMost DocWagon campaigns will be limited to a single city or\ndistrict that DocWagon services, though the characters can occa-\nsionally be “loaned out” to other DocWagon branches for training,\ndemonstration of new techniques and so forth. The gamemaster\ncan create some interesting variations by setting the campaign in\na place that offers other challenges than gunfights, such as a\nMediCarro campaign in war-torn Aztlan or a DocWagon adven-\nture In an uneasy border town like Denver.\n\nMedics working for DocWagon aren't likely to be physical or\nmagical powerhouses. The characters should be competent at cer-\ntain combat and self-defense skills as needed, but their primary\npurpose is to save lives, not beat people to a pulp. The player of\nsuch a character can channel the skill points and resources that he\nmight ordinarily have used to create a combat monster into addi-\ntional medical and social skills and abilities that can help the char-\nacter in his or her line of work.\n\nThe Goal\n\nThe player characters are members of an ambulance crew or\nsearch-and-rescue team that gets sent out to help a variety of\npeople in need of medical attention, almost always in highly dan-\ngerous situations, The characters’ first job Is to see to the safety\nand health of their patients—in this case to save lives, so the cam-\npaign should have a moral tone. The characters are doing difficult\nand dangerous work for little or no reward (by the standards of\nmany people in the Sixth World) and so they must be devoted to\ntheir jobs. Though DocWagon characters may get involved in the\nshadier side of the medical business—organlegging, drug smug-\ngling and so on—it makes for a better campaign if the characters\ntry to maintain the moral high ground. They may touch on the\nproblem of corruption while trying to root it out of their own orga-\nnization, for example.\n\nThe life of the patient is the most important consideration.\nCharacters risk themselves to save lives because that’s their job.\nSometimes they need to break rules to get that job done. And\nsometimes you don't manage to save the victim—so you try\nharder next time.\n\nMuch of the opposition that characters face in this kind of\ncampaign will be natural, impersonal forces: disaster, fire, disease,\nstreet warfare and so on. They might also have trouble with\ngroups of opponents likely to target a medical organization: eco-\nterrorists, ghouls, organ-smuggiers, rival companies and, of\ncourse, shadowrunners looking to heist a DocWagon vehicle for\ncover (what shadowrunning team hasn't tried this at some\npoint?).\n\nWhile a certain amount of violence might be permissible\nwhen a DocWagon crew is trying to get to a client, that doesn't\nmean the characters can blaze away at anyone in their path with-\nout having to answer to the law for it. Most of the violence likely\nto occur in a DocWagon campaign will be after the fact; this gives\nthe players an interesting opportunity to see the frequently gory\nresults of a “simple” shadowrun. For example, an HTR team may\nget called to a corporate site where a group of shadowrunners\nhave mowed through the guards and defenses; immediately on\narrival, the player characters must treat all the hapless guards who\nare still alive. They might find a clue that could nail those lousy\nshadowrunners, and they may well feel inclined to use it.\n\nComplications\n\nA search-and-rescue campaign allows the characters to go\ninto all kinds of dangerous and exciting situations with plenty of\nbackup at the home base. It also provides sanctions for high-\nspeed vehicle action and last-minute saves, and can send a\nrefreshing breath of heroism into the darkness of the Sixth World;\nfor once the characters are helping people and saving lives rather\nthan grubbing up nuyen. The gamemaster should make each\nDocWagon mission feel like a hour-long TV action drama.\n\nOn the other hand, heroic do-gooding may not be every-\none’s thing—especially for players who aren't interested in med-\nicine. Adventures can sometimes become routine, and maintain-\ning a variety of stories and opportunities for a DocWagon cam-\npaign is more difficult than for the standard shadowrunning game.\nPlayers may be frustrated by the lack of combat, lower power level\nor lack of financial reward for their heroism (though they should\nnet a fair amount of Karma to compensate).\n\nIn addition to the player characters, other important charac-\nters in a DocWagon campaign include the doctors and medical\npersonnel back at the hospital/clinic/home base, who may often\nbe in touch via the Matrix to offer assistance. Player characters\nmay also have to deal with company administrators, the local\nauthorities (police and others) and the occasional street doc or\nhealer whom the characters may befriend and help out on the sly\nfrom time to time. A final complication is the person being res-\ncued—how does he, she or it feel about it? Did DocWagon stop\nan extraction team from taking the patient unwillingly, or did he\nor she want to go with them? Has the patient become an employ-\nee without a corp? Did the patient get into trouble because he or\nshe intended to go out in a blaze of glory, and the DocWagon\nteam prevented a spectacular suicide? Did someone set up the\npatient to be murdered? The patient alone can lead to multiple\nadventures for the rescuers.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "SMILE, YOU'RE ON CAMERA!\n\nIn the 2050s, information is the purest kind of power.\nTherefore, corporations and governments spend a great deal of\ntime and money attempting to keep it to themselves. But one\ngroup exists that is dedicated to taking information from the\nPowers That Be and giving it to the common man—the news\nmedia. Much like today, the media hounds of the 2050s are the\nones who dig up the skeletons in the closets of the rich and pow-\nerful or shed light on the secrets that the megacorps don't want\nanyone to know. It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it—why\nnot your players?\n\nMost of the big media outfits in Shadowrun are controlled\nsecretly or openly by the megacorps, and so the characters will\nprobably be working for the bit players. They may be from a pirate\ntrid station, stealing bandwidth from authorized stations to broad-\ncast their sound bites and fleeing before security shows up. Or\nmaybe they're stringers, scrabbling for anything newsworthy and\nselling it to the highest bidder. Or they may work for a small local\nstation with a shoestring budget, fighting off hostile takeovers while\nbroadcasting the news that the major studios can't or won't touch.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nYou can create newshound characters with the standard\nShadowrun rules or the optional rules in Character Creation\n(beginning on p. 10). Players should also keep the following\nguidelines in mind. A pirate trid station would definitely need a\ndecker/electronics expert to wire up their broadcasting equip-\nment to override legitimate media traffic. In fact, a decker's unpar-\nallelled ability to track down data and uncover hidden information\nmakes him or her especially useful in any media-related cam-\npaign, Unless the team works solely for the datafaxes, they will\nwant at least one high-Charisma “face” person to make the actual\nbroadcasts. The rest of the team can be camera people, techni-\ncians and security people, all of whom will surely have other tal-\nents they can use to keep the team alive and effective. Combat\nskills may not be the team’s first priority, but newshound charac-\nters should definitely have them; uncovering corruption in the\nmegacorps and governments of the Sixth World Is a good way to\nget dead if you can’t defend yourself. Mage characters can be use-\nful to a news team if they have masking, invisibility and other\n“stealth” spells. A good rigger, who can get you the heck out of\ntrouble when the drek goes down, is also an asset.\n\nAnyone who might appear on camera or have to deal one-\non-one with sources should definitely have high Charisma; in\naddition, good Etiquette and Negotiation skills are crucial when\ntracking down leads. Stealth is also handy when trying to surrep-\ntitiously record scandalous meetings or covert operations, and\nInterrogation is great for hitting those corporate mouthpieces with\na barrage of revealing, rapid-fire questions. But the most crucial\npart of a newshound character is his contacts. A newshound\nshould have plenty, from as many different walks of life as possi-\nble to give him or her the best leads fast.\n\nADVENTURE IDEAS\nNews media adventures can start from almost any premise:\nan overheard conversation. an anonymous tip or the reporter's\n\never-popular “gut feeling.” Any sign of corporate cruelty, govern-\nment cover-ups, shadowrunning activity or other ratings-grabbers\nwill surely draw reporters like flies on drek.\n\nIn most media campaigns, the characters’ primary goal is to\nget incriminating evidence on film, then broadcast it so that the\npublic at large knows about the dirty deeds being done. Whether\nthat means following chemical tankers as they dump toxic wastes\non a wildlife preserve or recording a meeting between a mayoral\ncandidate and a Mafia don, these jobs will require excellent inves-\ntigative skills, subtlety, stealth and (if discovered) the ability to lee\nat high speed. Of course, broadcasting the story doesn't end the\nadventure; the megacorps and other powerful miscreants are not\nknown for their “live and let live” attitude toward those who\nreveal their dirty laundry to the public. The characters must either\nmaintain a high profile and hope that the targets of their exposés\nwon't dare take action against them, or drop out of sight until the\nheat cools off.\n\nIf the characters develop a large public following, an\nunscrupulous corporation (pretty much all of them) might\ndecide to use the characters to frame an appropriate victim.\nWith an “anonymous tip,” the corp puts the characters on the\ntarget's trail and then uses illusion magic, disguises or high-tech\ntrickery (whatever is at their disposal) to give the characters\n“proof” that the target is doing something shady. The characters\ntake the bait, the target is publicly crucified, and if the frame-up\njob comes out it'll be up to the characters to prove they were\ninnocent dupes instead of co-conspirators. (And even proving\nthat has its price—what media hound really wants the public to\nknow he can be fooled?)\n\nThe characters may also occasionally be hired by shadowrun-\nners who are investigating some manner of coverup and want\nconcrete proof of their findings. An interesting way to use this\ntype of adventure is to have the runners alert the news team of\ntheir suspicions, then get mercilessly slaughtered as they com-\nmence their investigation. Now the newsies are the only people\nwho know the deadly secret that the corp (or whoever) is hiding,\nand they must decide whether or not to risk their lives by taking\nup where the dead runners left off.\n\nFinally, a gamemaster who wants to get his players involved\nwith the Sixth World's real movers and shakers can use the sce-\nnario described in KSAF, p. 45 in the Threats sourcebook. An\nunknown source constantly sends the characters clues to major\nnews events that are about to happen, giving them just enough\ntime to arrive on the scene and record the historic happenings.\nThe characters may wind up covering a lot of things that the\nPowers That Be prefer to be forgotten, and any number of people\nwill wonder where the characters get their information—including\nthe characters themselves! This premise could be the basis for an\ninteresting, high-action campaign that reaches its climax when\nthe characters finally think they've figured out who their source is\n(and then must decide what to do about it).\n\nCAMPAIGNING WITH MEDIA TEAMS\n\nThe following section complements the Archetypal\nAdventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fiesh-\ning out some of the concepts presented in that section.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "The player characters are all part of a team working for a\nmajor or pirate media network, or else they are freelance news\nhounds. They specialize in handling the hot stories that often put\nthem in the line of fire; they also dig up the dirt on the world’s\nmegacorporations and governments, often information that these\npowers do not want broadcast. The pirate news station KSAF,\ndescribed in the Threats sourcebook, makes a useful basis for this\ntype of campaign: plenty of the information in the Shadowbeat\nsourcebook is also appropriate to running a media-based game.\n\nThis type of campaign can vary greatly in scale depending on\nthe desires of your players. A news team might confine most of\nits reporting to a single metroplex, or the team might travel ail\nover the world to track down the hot news and top stories.\nGenerally, the larger the news organization for which the charac-\nters work, the more influence their stories will have (and the cor-\nrespondingly greater risks they must take to get the story out).\n\nThis type of campaign can take place in a wide variety of set-\ntings. The player characters can go anywhere a potential news\nstory may break, from corporate boardrooms to the harsh back\nalleys of the Barrens and more.\n\nThe Goal\n\nIt is possible to uncover the truth. The public has a right to be\ninformed, and information must be free—especially in the Sixth\nWorld, where control of information means control over people's\nlives. Many people in power prefer to conceal their activities from\nthe media's eye, or want to distort the truth for their own ends.\nReporters must therefore remain objective, but also must always\nstruggle with the Powers That Be to get their stories out.\n\nThe moral questions of a media campaign can range far\nbeyond the simple issues of mercenary work and violence. The\nplayer characters must make decisions about what types of stories\nthey will cover and how. Because so much of the media in the\nSixth World is censored by government or corporate owners, the\ncharacters will have to deal with the consequences of that cen-\nsorship in one way or another—working with a pirate network or\nwithin the structure of an existing “legit” network. A media cam-\npaign, which gives player characters a chance to influence events\nthrough their reporting, can have an entirely different tone from\nthe typical shacdowrunning game. Gamers interested in the com-\nplex, behind-the-scenes plots of the Sixth World will find a media\ncampaign an interesting opportunity to explore those kinds of\nstories. Conspiracy and investigation buffs can have a lot of fun,\nand the gamemaster can also give the characters a chance to hob-\nnob with some of the major players of the Shadowrun universe.\n\nFew media hounds are physical or magical powerhouses. A\nmedia character's power lies in entirely different directions than\nthat of most shadowrunners: information and influence. A talent-\ned and respected reporter character can wield considerable power\nwithout having wired reflexes or a massive Combat Pool. Though\nnewshound characters are likely to need some combat skills and\nabilities to handle the dangerous situations they will tend to\nencounter, a media campaign is likely to be less combat-oriented\nthan most other campaigns in Shadowrun,\n\nThe major antagonists for a media campaign are rival news\norganizations working to get the best stories and information first,\nand the people who don't want their affairs exposed by a bunch\nof pushy newshounds. The characters can easily fall into a situa-\ntion where they know too much to be allowed to live, much less\nreport what they know. The Dragon's Last Dance, pp. | |~20 of\nPortfolio of a Dragon, highlights some of the hazards that media\ncharacters face every day.\n\nThough reporter characters are likely to cover violent incidents,\nthey rarely engage in violence themselves. Most media teams will\nuse violence only in self-defense, and any group as subject to deal-\ning with the authorities as a local news team must answer for any\nviolent acts they commit. Media characters must therefore careful-\nly consider the actions they Intend to take. In a media-team cam-\npaign, the pen is often truly mightier than the sword.\n\nComplications\n\nAn investigative media-based campaign can be frustrating to\nplayers who are looking for combat action, The restrictions under\nwhich a media team must operate are vastly different from the\n“ground rules” that apply to a typical group of shadowrunners,\nand some players might find working (mostly) within the law a\nserious cramp in their style. There is also the danger that the\nreporter character or characters might overshadow the other sup-\nporting characters in the campaign. To avoid this, the gamemas-\nter should flesh out various NPCs that the player characters will\nwork with—the news team’s editor or producer and the workings\nof the player characters’ network should be described in detail.\nThe gamemaster should also flesh out all the newshounds’ con-\ntacts and informants, as well as the important people that the\nplayer characters might be interested in investigating. A media\ncampaign requires a proactive gamemaster who is willing to let\nthe mystery unfold over the course of the game.\n\nTRAINED TO BE GHOSTS\n\nMost countries have an elite group within their militaries who\ngo through rigorous screening and training programs to become\nthe top-secret arm of the government assigned to taking on the\nmissions that are too weird, too dangerous or too controversial to\nperform openly. These special-forces characters spy on others,\nsteal or copy confidential data, eliminate key problems, blow stuff\nup, help “freedom fighters” and assassinate national leaders of\nquestionable morality. Sound familiar?\n\nSpecial forces are essentially the government's topnotch\nshadowrunners. They perform many of the same functions for\nlargely the same reasons as the ordinary street runner performs\nfor the corps. They are officially employed and so are not quite as\ndeniable as the average runner if something goes wrong, but their\ntraining ensures that what they lose in deniability they make up in\ntalent and loyalty.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nCreate special-forces characters according to the standard\nrules, but do not use the optional rules for Enemies (p. 71).\nThough special-forces characters can certainly create Enemies by\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "the dozen during game play, having a lot of money or cyberware\nis not enough to make people kill you automatically in the real\nworld. Special-forces characters can also ignore the Availability\noptional rule when procuring weapons and armor. The characters\nare on their government's tab; if the mission requires a Panther\nassault cannon, the taxpayers make sure that the characters have\none. (On the other hand, getting BTLs on a military base can be\ntough.) The characters’ two free contacts are automatically their\ncommanding officer and quartermaster (the person who man-\nages their equipment), Any additional contacts must be pur-\nchased. Characters will also receive an annual wage of 75,000\nnuyen—enough for a Medium Lifestyle and some extras.\nObviously, the Sixth World's governments need all types of\nshadowrunners from deckers to riggers to muscleboys, and most\nwill hire all types of metahumanity. Possible exceptions are gov-\nernments of a specific race—for example, the elven nation of Tir\nTairngire. whose members prefer to hire their fellow elves when-\never possible (though they might find trolls and orks perfectly\nacceptable as cannon fodder).\n\nADVENTURE IDEAS\n\nMilitary campaigns can involve regular soldiers, but special\nforces are the type of character closest to shadowrunners. They\nwork in small units and are extremely well-equipped; for exam-\nple, a government will actually spend a million nuyen on a spe-\ncial-forces operative to make him the ultimate cybered machine,\nas opposed to a regular soldier who gets a smartgun link and an\narmored jacket. Finally, special forces are required to keep their\noperations classified.\n\nGaming groups are likely to know and want to use varying\nlevels of detail about special forces. As an example of a typical\nspeciai-forces team, a UCAS Delta Force twelve-man “A-Team” is\ncommanded by a captain (CPT) who changes every three years;\nthe rest of the team stays together for life. The second-in-com-\nmand is the Chief Warrant Officer (CWO), This character must at\nsome point have been a non-commissioned officer (NCO) with\none of the following specialties: Operations and Intelligence,\nMedical Technician, Communications Technician, Weapons\nSpecialist. or Demolitions Specialist. Magic is considered a subset\nof these specialities, depending on its use. The rest of the team\nare non-commissioned officers.\n\nEach team will have as its senior NCO a Master Sergeant\n(MSG-E-8). This character is the Operations and Intelligence spe-\ncialist who gets his hands on the required intelligence to plan the\nmission, The Sergeants-First Class (SFC E-7) are a well-trained\nmedical technician and a demolitions expert. The medic is quali-\nfied to perform certain types of surgery and authorized to carry\ncontrolled narcotics for medical purposes. The demolitions expert\ncan use all known forms of explosives, whether manufactured or\nimprovised, and usually carries any such materiel on a mission.\n\nStaff Sergeants (SSG E-6) include the communications officer,\nwho knows how to operate his own and the enemy's communi-\ncations equipment. He can also create communicators of some\nkind from whatever happens to be handy, Another SSG is the\nweapons specialist, trained in the use of almost all known light or\nmedium weapons. This officer should be able to use field artillery\n\nand even tanks If necessary. The remainder of the team are addi-\ntional Staff Sergeants and Sergeants (SGT E-5). All of the special-\nties described are suggestions for assigning skills, histories and\nappropriate equipment to various characters; none of these pro-\nvide a game bonus unless the gamemaster chooses to assign such\nan advantage. Before embarking on any mission, the special\nforces personnel are isolated for at least three days.\n\nSpecial-forces missions often involve travel, frequently to\nhostile nations where the characters carry out threats and assassi-\nnations or aid rebellious freedom fighters. Characters can also per-\nform intelligence-gathering missions, datasteals, interrogations\nand spy missions against foreign governments or against “unde-\nsirables” in their own country. They can function as an elite unit\nsent to handle the most dangerous jobs during a war, or perform\nthe ever-popular mission where “something weird happened to\nthe last group we sent in, and you've got to stop whatever's\ngoing on.”\n\nCAMPAIGNING WITH SPECIAL FORCES\n\nThe following section complements the Archetypal\nAdventure Plots section, p. [01 of Running the Game, by flesh-\ning out some of the concepts presented in that section.\n\nThe Premise\n\nA special-forces campaign resembles a regular shadowrun—\nbut with certain important differences. Most special-forces cam-\npaigns will not be centered around legwork—special forces are\ntrained to act decisively, not chase clues around—and so contacts\nbecome a less important aspect of the game, The characters will\nhave the same “Mr. Johnson” every time—their commanding offi-\ncer—and they must cultivate his trust and respect in order to stay\non the team. If the gamemaster wants to start the characters out\nin boot camp and roleplay their selection and training, that can\nsignificantly intensify the relationship with their CO.\n\nThe Goal\n\nWhen playing a special-forces game, emphasize the charac-\nters’ loyalty to their country. That country need not be the UCAS;\nimagine a Tir Ghosts or Sioux Wildcats campaign. The characters\nare not freelancers; though they do get paid for their work, they\nshould do it primarily out of patriotism and loyalty. They must suc-\nceed in their missions at all costs and they rarely have any input\ninto their orders. To a special-forces character, the job is an honor\nand the goal is to succeed for the glory or well-being of his coun-\ntry. Ifa character doesn’t want to play that game. he or she should\nleave for the more lucrative life of a shadowrunner.\n\nOpposition\n\nThe opposition for any special-forces team is likely to be\nanother special-forces team: an opposing government's hit\nsquad, corporate security on red alert, or even freelancers out to\nmake a name for themselves. Terrorists also make excellent vil-\nlians for a special-forces campaign. For less military, more spy-ori-\nented missions, the primary “opposition” may be the sheer diffi-\nculty of infiltrating the target area or organization and then getting\nout alive. These missions are extremely dangerous for many rea-\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeanion"

        "text": "sons; they are usually long-term, an agent involved in one may\nwell go “over the wall” and join the other side, or the agent may\nget caught and simply disappear.\n\nComplications\n\nSpecial-forces characters must learn to work together. Unlike\nordinary shadowrunners, they cannot choose whom to work with\nor kill a teammate they dislike. This arrangement can be good for\ngroup harmony as players learn to work out in-character differ-\nences. The characters must also concentrate on teamwork to make\nsure their missions stay secret. If they are ordered to assassinate\na dictator and they hose it, they can’t just pack up and run the way\na shadowrunner often can. They must answer to the rest of their\nunit and their government.\n\nAlso. military/special-forces characters are more likely to\nhave normal lives than shaclowrunners. Such characters may\nhave spouses, children, parents and siblings whom they talk to\nand care about, or friends outside the military, Gamemasters\nshould take this element of their player characters’ lives into\naccount when the campaign needs a change of pace. For exam-\nple. if characters are used to calling the President for the mission\nplan and necessary equipment, they might have to think hard\nabout what to do when they hear from an old friend who needs\ntheir help because he’s gotten on the wrong side of the Mob.\nThey have the skills to accomplish what needs to be done. but\nthe necessity of operating outside their orders might force them\nto reevaluate their careers in terms of their dedication to country\nor to family. They would also need to decide whether to operate\noutside the sanctions of the government, ask their superior offi-\ncer for help, “borrow” equipment from the “office,” and other\nmoral dilemmas.\n\n1 AM THE LAW\n\nPlaying corporate security or police officers, whether from\nLone Star. Knight Errant or smaller outfits, offers players a differ-\nent look at the Sixth World, In many ways these characters resem-\nble shadowrunners; they have many of the same skills and abili-\nties, some of the same interests, and often the same functions.\nBoth types of teams include varied characters—deckers, magi-\ncians and combat-types—and get involved every day in the\ndown-and-dirty, take-your-life-in-your-hands aspect of the Sixth\nWorld. And security specialists or law enforcement characters live\nwith almost the same level of danger as shadowrunners—in fact.\nthey're the ones that the runners come after. There are some sig-\nnificant differences, however. For one thing, corporate guards and\ncops spend more time on intra-corp competition, bragging to\nimprove their reputations and actively soliciting the interesting\njobs. No one wants to go from being one of Knight Errant’s gold-\nen boys this week to elementary-school lunch duty next week\nbecause a rival spread jealous rumors.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nCreating cop and corporate-security characters is a little dif-\nferent than creating runners. To reflect the extent of corporate and\nlaw-enforcement discrimination, metahuman characters should be\nexceedingly rare—usually no more than one in any group.\n\nAmong the few metahumans, elves and dwarfs are more com-\nmon than trolls and orks. Skills must be at least C priority, reflect-\ning the fact that the characters have had training, and each char-\nacter must have at least two Knowledge Skills to reflect the fact\nthat they've had some sort of education. If you are using the\npoint-based system (pp. 20-21) to create your character, you\nmust allocate 24 points to Skills. Corporate/cop characters also\nautomatically receive one of the following Edges at the standard\ncost: Technical School, High School or College Education. As\nCorpSec personnel and Lone Star cops, the player characters\nshould make a high enough salary to maintain a Medium Lifestyle.\n\nUnlike shadowrunners, for whom a wide variety of specialties\non a team is necessary, cops and corp security are more likely to\nwork in one field. For example, everybody might play deckers\nwho are Fuchi's front line of defense for a campaign set entirely in\nthe Matrix. if all your players want to play magical characters, they\nmay be the “point team” for astral defense at the local Lone Star's\nmagical division.\n\nCop and corporate-security characters should have at least\ntwo Enemies at character creation, One should be a Rank |\nEnemy, the other Rank 2. The characters’ two free contacts must\nbe employees of their corporation or fellow cops at their precinct.\nPurchased contacts may be of any type.\n\nADVENTURE IDEAS\n\nCop and corporate-security campaigns offer opportunities for\nmore roleplaying and social interaction than the average shad-\nowrun. Characters must work reasonably within the law, and so\nwill almost always try to solve things by talking before resorting\nto violence. Despite Lone Star's brutal trid image, any cop who\nconsistently shoots before speaking will find himself in court or on\nthe streets pretty quickly. Cop and corporate-security characters\nalso have to work within a corporate structure, answering to high-\ner-ups, working together or competing with contemporaries anc\nmentoring newbies. This offers opportunities for social interaction\nbeyond contacts from whom characters get weapons and infor-\nmation, and also for enemies who subtly attack a character's\ncareer and ego rather than his physical person.\n\nWhen running cop/corp campaigns, keep in mind that when\nthe dangerous drek goes down, the first thing most cops do is call\nfor backup. This action may be realistic, but it isn’t much fun for\nthe players to know that their characters will always have fifty fel-\nlow cops ready to cover them should they screw up. The\ngamemaster must make sure that the characters can get into high-\nsuspense situations where a lot depends on a few moves made\nonly by the protagonists. In other words, look more to cop movies\nfor inspiration than to “real-world” police operations. Encourage\ncharacters to have moral codes, doing the right thing even if the\nchief has been bribed to look the other way, or to use their con-\ntacts and skills to help a group on the side of “good” but not on\nthe side of the law (metahuman rights, ecoterrorists and so on),\n\nAnother technique is the “nobody ever goes in or comes out”\nploy. The characters may not be able to cail for backup for some\nreason—for example, they've been kidnapped and their radios\ntaken, or they're inside a barrier like the Bug City containment\nzone. Alternatively, backup may not be able to reach them—ter-\n\nSHADOWRUN Comeantiaon"

        "text": "rorists may control of the building they're in, or they started\nexploring some mysterious sewer tunnels and now they don't\nknow where they are. Techniques like these put the story into the\nhands of the player characters, making for a more exciting and\nmemorable game.\n\nThe cop character has an ambiguous relationship with the\nstreets. He or she may have come from there, his or her most\ninteresting work takes place there, and yet the people of the\nstreets most likely despise and fear the cop. Nonetheless, cops\nmust be able to work with people in the shadows, When con-\nducting an investigation, having contacts is as helpful for cops as\nfor shadowrunners. Cops tend to use their contacts much more\nactively to “get a feel” for what's happening on the street. The\nNegotiation rules (Spilling the Beans, p. 69) can make these\ninterviews interesting. Some contacts may also have a hold over\nthe character; for example, a yakuza oyabun who helps a cop out\nwith the occasional bit of information may successfully blackmail\nthat same cop to open a smuggling channel into a local prison,\n\nWhen running a cop campaign, the gamemaster should have\na plausible reason for involving a small group of people rather\nthan a large team. Creating specialty teams or SWAT teams is one\nway to do this; having a big event occur elsewhere that drains all\nthe NPCs away so that the player characters are the only ones left\nis another. This type of campaign also works well if you have a\nvery small group of players (1-3) and would like to run an intimate\ngame that requires a lot of investigation rather than combat.\n\nCorporate security functions in the same way as cops for the\nmost part, save that they have an even more limited range of\noperations. Most often they stay on the grounds of their parent\ncorp. To keep the game varied, consider sending CorpSec charac-\nters on undercover missions or varying the types of security crises\n(a gang attack, an assault by chromed-to-the-teeth or magically\npowerful runners, an internal-affairs investigation, a rampage by\nwild paranormal animals, a wageslave gone postal and so on).\nYou can also create campaigns around personal friendships and\nenmities, or have the characters inadvertently uncover their corp's\ndirty secrets. Starting out with characters who work for\nAztechnology with no idea of its reputation, then having them\nstumble over increasingly clear evidence of blood magic and sac-\nrifices, can lead up to an emotional climax as the characters\ndecide whether to continue working for the corp they now know\nis evil or risk everything they have to do what is right. (If they\nleave, of course, they can go directly to traditional Shadowrun.)\n\nCorporate characters often have shaky relationships with their\nstreet contacts. Most often they are either bribing the contact for\ninformation—and they'd better keep up the payments in the\ngame or suffer the consequences—or they are personal friends\nfrom before the corp character went legit, in which case the char-\nacter must consider how deeply he or she wants to drag a friend\ninto trouble.\n\nCorp/cop adventures do not center around making money,\nand characters can’t really steal and/or loot bodies because they\nhave no access to a black market at which to sell their pickings.\nAn easy way to make the campaign tougher is to slash the cor-\nporate or precinct budget; this means the characters may not be\nable to get their hands on the best equipment, or even equipment\n\nthat works, and they may also not have the cash to grease all the\npalms that need it. As with special-forces campaigns, corporate\nand cop characters are more likely to have normal lives than shad-\nowrunners. If a character's whole family is tied up with the corpo-\nration, might he or she think twice about leaving after finding out\nabout Aztechnology’s evil experiments? Or if a cop spends\nmonths tracking down some piece of shadowrunner scum only to\nfind out that the runner is her little sister who ran away two years\nago, how will she react to that discovery?\n\nGoing Undercover\n\nAn adventure in which an individual or group must go under-\ncover is difficult to pull off and poses some obvious problems,\nsuch as the short life expectancy of an undercover character if his\nor her cover is broken. Also, the gamemaster must create a com-\nplete undercover environment for the character or the group,\nFinally, an undercover adventure is likely to be high on social skills\nand sweet talking, and low on combat action. If well-roleplayed,\nhowever, an undercover campaign can create an interesting story\nand loads of opportunity for character interaction.\n\nWhen playing an undercover character, design him or her as\nif the character actually is the person he is disguised as (shad-\nowrunner, organized-crime member, gang member). The charac-\nter must also have a Skill Rating of at least 3 in Corporate (Police)\nEtiquette and the type of Etiquette most neecied to succeed at his\nor her undercover profession.\n\nIf the players are willing to risk it, an undercover campaign\ncan lead to some intense and memorable scenes when a charac-\nter's cover is broken and he must break the law in order to prove\nhis loyalty to his new bosses. A super twist is to have an under-\ncover cop be a member of a shadowrunning team. Keep in mind\nthat no matter how well the character plays his or her runner\nrole—or even if the character decides he prefers his runner bud-\ndies to being a cop and ultimately takes to the street himself—\nother players and their characters don't like feeling foolish. When\nthe character's cover Is broken, as it will be eventually, that char-\nacter will have to do some quick and convincing talking to stay\nalive, and even then the enraged runners may kill the character\nout of spite.\n\nCAMPAIGNING WITH THE LAW\n\nThe following section complements the Archetypal\nAdventure Plots section, p. 10! of Running the Game, by flesh-\ning out some of the concepts presented in that section.\n\nThe Premise\n\nThe characters are trying to hang on to the moral high ground\nin a world of chaos. They stick to the ideal of the law, if not always\nthe letter of it, ancl must often face corruption in their own orga-\nnization. This premise makes an interesting change from most\ncampaigns, where the characters are “criminal scum” (shad-\nowrunners); cop characters might even find themselves outsmart-\ning and hauling in a few shadowrunners from time to time!\n\nLaw enforcement characters try to uphold the ideals of “good\ncops” and deal with crime and corruption in their jurisdiction as\nwell as within their organization, The player characters are mem-\n\nSHADOWRUN COMPANION"

        "text": "bers of a single crime squad, or perhaps an elite unit such as a\nLone Star Fast Response Team. They work together all the time,\nand form the kind of bonds that people only form with those who\nsave their necks on a regular basis; there are no loners in a cop\nsquad. The unit may include magicians and adepts as magical\nsupport, though such characters must answer to the magical spe-\ncialty division of the organization for which the characters work.\nMost cop squads also include a decker to provide needed techni-\ncal support.\n\nThe characters work in a distinct locale, dealing with criminal\nactivity in their particular city or precinct if they're cops and keep-\ning tabs on the corporate site to which they've been assigned if\nthey're CorpSec. Though they may have to deal with their com-\npany's or organization's home office at times, most of their atten-\ntion is confined to the local area.\n\nCop/corp campaigns lend themselves to any good-sized city\nor metroplex like Seattle. The gamemaster can create some inter-\nesting variations by choosing cities outside the UCAS or CAS and\nfocusing on those cities’ unique aspects and problems, such as\nLos Angeles, Denver, Vancouver (in Salish-Shidhe) and Portland\n(in Tir Tairngire).\n\nThe Goal\n\nTo a cop character, being a “good cop” is the most important\nthing in the world. Without good people to uphold the law, anar-\nchy reigns and people get hurt. There is nothing worse than a bad\ncop, because a bad cop corrupts the law. People deserve protec-\ntion from crime, and so sometimes you have to bend the rules a\nlittle to put criminals away. But you can’t bend the rules too much,\neven if sometimes that means letting the bad guys go. Cop and\nCorpSec characters have an immediate reason for working togeth-\ner and clearly set goals for dealing with criminal scum; they also\nhave enough leeway to act on their own initiative. They have\nfewer worries about getting gear than the average shadowrunner\ncharacter, and the gamemaster has more control over character\nadvancement. The cop/corp campaign shows players “the other\nside of the street” and lets them be on the side of Law and Order\nfor a change.\n\nOpposition\n\nThe player characters have plenty of ready-made opponents\nin the criminal element with which they must deal daily.\nOrganized crime offers quite a few powerful adversaries; the char-\nacters are also likely to tangle with small-time criminals such as\ngangs, smugglers, gamblers, con artists and shadowrunners.\n\nOther interesting opposition may be corruption within the\ncharacters’ organization or precinct. Bad cops. corrupt political\nofficials, political pressure from higher-ups and the like can be\nmuch more difficult for the characters to fight than simple street\nscum. Cop characters might also have trouble from rival police or\nsecurity organizations, especially if a contract dispute is going on\nor some other company wants to muscle in on the police business\nin the player characters’ city.\n\nThe campaign is likely to see plenty of violence with charac-\n\nters who work the mean streets every day, but the mayhem is of\na different kind than most shadowrunners encounter. Cops are\nbound by the law and company regulations about the use of\ndeadly force; sensational trid stories to the contrary, they should\nnever deal with a problem by shooting first and asking questions\nlater. Cop and CorpSec characters will have the advantage of the\nbest modern weapons and armor that nuyen can buy (unless their\ndepartment is underfunded, as many are); however, they should\nstill be careful. Shadowrunners can be tricky opponents, after all.\n\nComplications\n\nSome players may find the rules and restrictions of working\nin a police organization—especially the limits in equipment and\nadvancement—too constricting. Certain “square peg” character\ntypes such as shamans might have a tough time fitting into the\ncampaign. Also, the players can become complacent and lazy if all\ntheir characters’ activities are dictated by their superior officers.\n\nUnless the characters are part of an elite group like an FRT,\nthey probably aren't cyber-gods or Nth-grade initiates; they're\nmost likely just ordinary cops trying to do their job. The characters\nhave the advantages of professional training and whatever back-\ning and equipment their organization provides, so they shouldn't\nhave to worry much about scrounging for gear unless they want\nsomething that isn’t regulation.\n\nMagician characters will have free access to the organiza-\ntion’s magical equipment and resources, and may also have an in-\nhouse initiate group to teach them the higher mysteries at some\nfuture point. Decker characters will have the chance to play with\na number of systems legitimately (for a change), and they also\nhave free access to their own organization's hi-tech systems.\n\nThe company rules and regulations offer a plausible ratio-\nnale for the gamemaster to control character advancement and\nany new cyber or magical abilities that players want their char-\nacters to acquire.\n\nAs a general rule, the player characters stay in one area most\nof the time, leaving only when transferred to a different unit.\nHowever, such transfers may be as frequent as the gamemaster\ndesires. Corp security teams come up for review fairly often in the\nfast-paced economy of the Awakened world, and so player-charac-\nter teams could be transferred to anywhere in the world. They may\nbe ordered to shore up existing security, request a transfer upon\nrealizing that their superiors are corrupt or inefficient, or arrange for\ntheir own disappearance to another corp or the shadows.\n\nDOUBLE, DOUBLE TOIL AND TROUBLE\n\nThe magical campaign puts an interesting twist on a\nShadowrun game because it revolves around encounters with,\nresearch into and exploration of the eerie and often formidable\nmystic powers of the Awakened world. From uncovering the truth\nbehind Aztechnology to discovering the real purpose of the\nAtlantean Foundation or the ultimate scheme of the Iiluminates of\nthe New Dawn, magical investigations have an otherworldy feel\nthat players may find appealing. Less like shadowrunners and more\nlike scholarly Investigators, characters in a magical campaign face all\nkinds of dangers—especially the fear of the unknown.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPrnnion"

        "text": "CHARACTER CREATION\n\nMost or all of the player characters in a magical campaign\nshould have some kind of magical ability, though the occasional\nmundane character can be added to make things interesting. This\ntype of campaign works best if all the player characters are mem-\nbers of the same magical order or lodge or other initiatory group;\nthis automatically gives them a history together and will likely\ngive them a goal as well, Many of the characters’ activities must\nremain hidden in order to conceal the order's secrets from mun-\ndane humanity. The group may work toward the goals of their\norder, lodge, government or organization, or may work against\nanother organization. The magical campaign offers a perfect\nopportunity to use the adept characters that appear in many\nShadowrun products.\n\nA magical campaign can be more aggressive on all levels if\nits members are working for someone else, preferably a powerful\nbacker. In this case, not all the team members need be magically\nactive. The Atlantean Foundation’s Mystic Crusaders (p. 58,\nThreats) are an excellent organization for this type of campaign,\nas is the Dunkelzahn Institute for Magical Research (p. 25,\nPortfolio of a Dragon),\n\nADVENTURE IDEAS\n\nThe world of Shadowrun is full of magical sites, items, peo-\nple, creatures, spirits and organizations. Most are secret; some\nare so secret that the only evidence of their existence is the occa-\nsional whispered rumor. A magical campaign can easily take on\nthe feel of a regular shadowrun—for example, sneaking into the\nlocal Aztechnology facility to find out what magical research Is\ngoing on there. Others may feel like an archaeological expedii-\ntion—such as investigating a power site, mana line or magical\nanomaly like the Mojave Desert. Still other adventures may cast\nthe player characters as astral investigators looking into the meta-\nplanes. And of course, an ongoing covert war against another\nmagical group or society is always a good adventure hook.\n\nCAMPAIGNING WITH MAGIC\n\nThe following section complements the Archetypal\nAdventure Plots section, p. 10! of Running the Game, by flesh-\ning out some of the concepts presented in that section.\n\nThe Premise\n\nCharacters in a magical campaign travel wherever they must\nfor their work. They might hit the Bermuda Triangle one week,\nEgypt the next and Glastonbury, England the week after that. This\ntype of campaign lets the gamemaster offer a wide variety of\nexotic and magical settings for adventures, but also makes it\nextremely important for the characters to have a stable \"home\nbase” with their organization so that they can deal with regular\nrecurring NPCs.\n\nMagicans as a group tend to feel that they have a greater stake\nin the workings of the universe because magic is neither good nor\nbad—that judgment applies only to specific uses of it. And “bad\nmagic” is almost always very, very bad. Therefore, magical cam-\npaigns tend to be large-scale, with far-reaching implications for at\nleast the characters’ magical order and possibly even the world.\n\nThe Goal\n\nThis type of campaign is ideal for players who want to\nexplore different aspects of magic in the Sixth World, including\nthe metaplanes and the many different types of spirits and para-\nnormal critters. It also offers the chance to use different exotic\nlocations. The tone of a magical campaign Is open to interpreta-\ntion, but assumes that the piayer characters are all seeking knowl-\nedge and truth (however they define it) and have plans for using\nthat knowledge. If the players can handle the complexity, their\ngroup might even have a mixture of goals and motivations. Some\ncharacters might seek knowledge for its own sake, some might be\nlooking for magical power, and others may be seeking to protect\nmundane humanity from various magical threats.\n\nThe moral tone of the campaign, whatever it may be, can be\nstrongly expressed through the strictures of the magical group to\nwhich the characters belong (p. 54, Grimoire). This set-up gives\nthe campaign some added weight because a character who vio-\nlates too many strictures can be expelled from the order. If this\nhappens, the character would most likely have to leave the group.\n\nOpposition\n\nThe major opponents characters are likely to face in this type of\ncampaign are members of rival magical orders. Knowledge is\npower, and magicians seek knowledge above all else. Rival groups\nworking at cross purposes may contend with each other to get their\nhands on some valuable magical lore, or to snatch a hidden magi-\ncal treasure from some ancient site or ruin. Groups like the\nIluminates of the New Dawn, Aztlan blood mages, the Black\nLodge, Winternight and the Atlantean Foundation are all possible\nrivals for the player characters (for more information on these\ngroups, see Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon). Individual magi-\ncians such as toxic shamans can also provide hefty challenges.\n\nOther major antagonists for a magical order are powerful\nspirits: free spirits, insect spirits and even the mysterious Enemy,\nif the gamemaster so desires. The free spirit Tutor (p. 92, Threats)\nmakes an excellent opponent, as do many of the other magical\nenemies described in that sourcebook.\n\nThough the magical campaign is primarily investigative, it has\nthe potential for some truly spectacular magical battles, as well as\ngrand-scale physical conflict on the astral plane and the meta-\nplanes. Mundane characters may be most useful in this type of\ncampaign as bodyguards for the less brawny magicians in the\ngroup. If desired, the characters might be members of a physical-\nly-oriented organization, such as a martial arts dojo. Such a cam-\npaign would be well-suited for physical adept and physical magi-\ncian characters (see p. 119, Awakenings).\n\nComplications\n\nThe campaign's focus on magic can be its greatest weakness\nas well as its greatest strength. For players not especially interest-\ned in magic, a magical campaign can quickly grow tiresome. Also,\na magical campaign's narrow focus can tend to make all the play-\ner characters seem the same; they all know the same spells, have\nsimilar magical skills, and so on. To avoid this pitfall, the\ngamemaster should encourage players to create more specialized\ncharacters than a typical Shadowrun magician.\n\nSHADOWRUN COomPAnION"

        "text": "Player characters are likely to develop considerable magical\npower as the campaign progresses, and so gamemasters are\nadvised to keep a close eye on how characters spend their Karma\nfor advancement. Remind your players that non-magical skills and\nabilities are useful in various situations, and encourage the players\nto buy them. The gamemaster may also wish to set an upper limit\non magical skills such as sorcery and conjuring so that no charac-\nter grows out of control.\n\nTHIS IS OUR TURF, MEAT\n\nShadowrun makes an ideal environment for a gang campaign.\nThis type of campaign allows players to play characters who don't\nhave it all under control. They're just above squatters on the food\nchain and have to fight for every inch of ground they get. They can't\nfight without thought because there are predators a lot bigger and\nmeaner than they are on the streets. So if gang characters want to\nsurvive, they have to think. A last-resort home of sorts for people\nwho've been used and abused by the system, a gang Is a social\nclub, shadowrunning group, terrorist organization and law enforce-\nment (of a sort) for their home turf. Usually led by a charismatic\nleader, gangers tend to belong to disenfranchised groups: racial,\nethnic or economic. They band together and form mini-societies\nwith their own rules, attitudes, prejudices and goals.\n\nA gang campaign offers an immediate means of getting a\ngroup of characters together and keeping them that way by forg-\ning bonds of cooperation and loyalty between them. The cam-\npaign also allows for a lower power level so that the players and\ngamemaster can concentrate on character development and per-\nsonal interaction rather than simply accumulating various toys.\n\nThe following campaign notes apply to small neighborhood\nor area gangs. not city-wide or national forces.\n\nGANG CREATION\n\nForming a gang gives outcast individuals the protection of\nnumbers and the advantage (physical and psychological) of back-\nup when on the offensive. They also provide the only way for a\nshadowrunner wannabe to have something to hold onto in a\nworld gone crazy. The gang gives him a group of friends his own\nage, to whom he is loyal and who are loyal to him. He gets to feel\na part of something bigger and more powerful than his own\ninsignificant self. He gets status within the gang that he could\nnever have outside it, which attracts girls and makes him look\ntough to other guys. To reflect these factors, all gangs have the\ntrappings of an intiate group; they must maintain rituals, know\ncodes and undergo intiations.\n\nUsing the following guidelines, the gamemaster should\ndevelop the concept for a gang before the players create their\ngang characters.\n\nGang Focus\n\nThe gang focus is the reason why this group of individuals\ngot together. Because gang members are all like-minded individ-\nuals, the gang focus is usually narrow and frequently based on\nhatred of something or someone. The most common gangs are\nthose in which the members are all one race: trolls, elves, humans\nand so on. The flip side is almost as common—multi-racial gangs\n\nwhose focus is mutual hatred of one race in particular. If a gang's\nfocus is to unite all the neighborhood trolls, then obviously all of\nthe gang members will be trolls. If a gang's focus Is hatred of\ntrolls, people of any race aside from trolls can join. A gang's focus\nmight also be to fight a megacorp whose activities or products\nhave been killing “our kind”; these types of gangs are especially\ncommon in Oakland, California Free State. Gangs like this will\naccept recruits of any race who pledge to help bring down “the\nenemy.” Still other gangs are generally anti-corp, anti-govern-\nment, and so on.\n\nInitation Rituals\n\nThese rituals can be anything that a ganger must undergo to\nbecome a member. The ritual can include personal pain, a partic-\nular mission, hazing, tattooing or scarring and so on, and usually\nalso involves an oath or vow. The initiation ritual to become a lieu-\ntenant may be different than the ritual to become a member; the\nritual might change with a gang's leader, or a new leader might\nrequire the gang members to renew their vow or oath to show\nloyalty to him or her. Upon successfully completing the ritual, a\nnew recruit is considered a full-fledged member of the gang.\n\nUniforms\n\nKnown commonly as colors, gang uniforms can be anything\nfrom red bandannas and red socks to the complete uniform of the\nNew York Yankees baseball team circa 1918. Everything from a\nparticular piece of clothing worn to a type of weapon used may\nbe part or all of the uniform. Uniforms let people know exactly\nwhat gang a gang member belongs to, and gangers consider it\ndishonorable to remove their colors for any reason.\n\nSymbol\nA gang's symbol is used to mark their territory; gangers may\n\nalso wear the symbol as a tattoo or a logo on their jackets.\n\nTerritory\n\nTerritory is the gang's home turf, its boundaries usually\nmarked by their symbol. Any given gang's turf Is usually in one\narea of a city and is patrolled by the gang members. Patrols are\nespecially likely if a gang shares a border with an enemy gang.\nTerritory is a gang's ego reflected; members of other gangs are\nrarely allowed to cross a rival's territory, though a gang's turf may\ninclude limited “free” or “safe” zones such as the local street doc’s\nclinic of a school. A good rule of thumb for determining the size\nof a gang's territory is to make it a number of city blocks equal to\nthe number of gang members (including NPCs). Keeping within\nthat limit should make it possible for the gang to patrol its turf.\n\nOperations\n\nOperations are the gang's main cash cow (or cows). The\ngangers may be front men for the yakuza, roughing up business-\nes that don’t pay their protection money on time. Or they may run\ntheir own protection racket. They may sell BTLs, smuggle contra-\nband, strip cars, or anything else likely to earn them money to live\non and to finance their particular war.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPeannion"

        "text": "Uniqueness\n\nEach gang has a unique style; maybe they only fight with\nkatanas, or maybe they're all orks. Go-gangs are a unique type of\nstreet gang because they only ride cycles; one of the more unique\ngo-gangs is the one that only deals in highway robbery between\nSeattle and Portland. They rarely kill anyone and always take the\ncustoms papers for the border. Other gangs are known for the\ntype of shadow businesses they take on, as weil as how they per-\nform that business. Names, pets, main squeezes, hobbies and\nfighting tactics may all define a gang’s uniqueness. The only lim-\nits are the players’ imaginations and the gamemaster's approval.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nNo gang character may start with more than 90,000 nuyen. If\nyou are using the priority system of character creation, that means\nthe character cannot make resources Priority A or B. Depending\non the gang's make-up, a character's race may or may not matter.\n\nAll gangs have Enemies, most of them other gangs. To find\nout how many gangs are Enemies for the player characters, the\ngamemaster should divide the number of gang member player\ncharacters by 2 (round fractions up). (The bigger you are, the more\npeople want to take you down, right?) For gamemastering pur-\nposes, treat all rival gangs as Rank 2 Enemies. Each player char-\nacter will also have an individual Rank | Enemy: a member of a\nrival gang, a squatter, a BTL dealer, a prostitute or other street per-\nson whom the ganger has slotted off, a corporate wage slave that\nhe has inadvertently (or intentionally) hurt, even a member of his\nown gang who dislikes him because of some past slight. These\nEnemies will often prefer to humiliate the character rather than kill\nhim outright.\n\nIf a player purchases Gang Background for 50 percent of his\ncharacter's starting nuyen, then that character is the gang leader\nat the beginning of the campaign. If more than one player wants\nhis character to be leader, the one who spends the highest per-\ncentage of his or her starting income on Gang Background wins\nthe honor. If a player cannot roleplay a charismatic leader, don't\nexpect the other player characters to be willing to listen to him.\nNPCs may stay loyal for a little longer, but they won't stick by a\ncomplete frag-off either. Gangs are nothing if not disorganized,\nand a leader who can't keep his followers’ loyalty won't last very\nlong (see Leadership Battle, p. 124), The rest of the player char-\nacters are lieutenants, to differentiate them from NPCs and regu-\nlar gangers. Because of his or her position of power, the leader\ngets a a second Rank | Enemy. (It's tough at the top.)\n\nThe gang as a whole gets a single Fixer Contact at Level 1.\nThis contact is established when the gang is created, and does not\ncount as an individual contact. The fixer fences the gang's booty\n(if any; see Special Rules, p. 123).\n\nGang members usually aren't a well-educated bunch. Many\nhave not completed high school and extremely few have gone to\ncollege. To reflect this, no ganger can have starting Knowledge,\nTechnical or Magical Skill ratings above 3, including Sorcery,\nConjuring, Magical Theory, Demolitions and Computer skills. In addi-\ntion, the Edges of High Schoo! Education, College Education and\n\nTechnical School are all double the standard cost. The point of a\nganger campaign is to have fun without being the best at anything.\n\nGangers tend to have less money than other types of charac-\nters and they don't know very many people with money. This\nmeans they can't always get their hancis on what they want, even\nwhen they have the nuyen. To reflect this, gangers cannot have\nany starting gear with an Availability higher than 5.\n\nWhen creating a gang, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 per the\ntules for Gangs/Tribesmen (p. 44, SRII), Gang members created\nthis way are NPCs that the gamemaster may allow the players to\ncontrol. These gangers belong to the entire group, not to any indi-\nvidual gang member or leader, and do not count as contacts for\ncharacter creation. All gangers are assumed to know others in\ntheir gang; aside from that, ganger characters get the normal\nnumber of Contacts or Buddies per standard rules. Gangers are\nnot likely to have non-Street contacts; if they do, there should be\nan interesting story behind the friendship, For more information\non generating a gang, see Gang Creation, p. 121.\n\nBecause most gangs lack resources and funds, they rarely\nboast mages among their number. Cyberware is also a relative rar-\nity, though the less-expensive stuff trickles down to the back\nstreets. Deckers are the rarest characters in a gang because of the\ncost of equipment and most gangers’ lack of training and cyber-\nware. Many a gang member sports a datajack, but actual Matrix\naccess is uncommon. Riggers, by contrast, are common. Taking\nvehicles and borrowing parts to jury-rig faster or more powerful\nvehicles are all a part of life for many gangs.\n\nGang Options\nThe character creation rules above apply to the “typical”\n\nstreet gang; by using a few variations, the gamemaster can create\nseveral other gang types.\n\nThe basic concept behind an all-elf gang might be a bunch\nof bored rich kids convinced of their own superiority. Unlike other\ngangs, they aren't fighting for their lives; instead, they're out to\ndestroy their “inferiors.” They would have more money and pres-\ntige than a regular street gang; characters can have up to\n400,000 nuyen (Priority B to Resources) as starting money.\nMages are more common in all-elf gangs than in regular gangs,\nand the members are generally better educated. On the other\nhand, elf gangs have twice as many Enemies as a regular gang,\nand must maintain at least a Medium Lifestyle.\n\nThe tribesmen gang is not the usual urban gang; this type of\ngang operates between cities or on very localized turf. Tribesmen\nare almost always human Native Americans; metahuman mem-\nbers must also be from NAN lands or have Native American\nblood. The tribesmen follow the standard rules for street gangs,\nexcept that one character—usually the leader—must be a shaman.\nWhether or not the shaman is the leader, his or her totem will be\npart of the gang's symbol. Deckers and riggers are scarce in tribes-\nmen groups. Only the leader will have City or Street contacts; all\nother contacts should be Rural or Tribal.\n\nThe decker gang is a specialized type of gang whose leader\nmust start the game with 1,000,000 nuyen (Priority A to\nResources). The 50-percent Gang Background fee buys the leader\n\nSHADOWRUN COomPAnION"

The Gang Background/Leadership fee in this\nCase serves as a recruitment tool. Decker gangers have no cash or\neducation limits, though only the leader should have any Street\ncontacts, The rest of the gangers have contacts via the Matrix. The\ngamemaster determines if a given Matrix contact is the real deal\nor a Matrix poser.\n\nADVENTURE IDEAS\n\nGang campaigns operate on a different scale than shad-\nowruns; they usually boil down to helping your own gang, hurt-\ning a rival gang, or internal power plays. Because gangs function\nin many ways like miniature crime families, most gang campaigns\nshould use the Karma and the Amoral Campaign rules (p. 78).\nGangs run small smuggling and theft rings, protection rackets,\nBTL deals, even prostitution rackets. The point of playing a gang\nis to fight the gang's Enemies, and in order to do that the gang\nneeds nuyen to equip themselves for their ongoing war. The eco-\nnomics of the gang's operations is determined by the gamemas-\nter, but keep in mind that the average small-time street gang usu-\nally acts as middlemen (see Special Rules, below).\n\nGang wars are the bread and butter of a gang's existence.\nGang wars can run the gamut from bragging and posturing to fist\nand knife fights to blazing firefights and all-out destruction. Many\ngang wars are one-on-one battles; for the character being “called\nout” in this way, even a knife fight can be as intense and sus-\npenseful as a war. Gang rivalries are also dynamic; an exciting\nmini-campaign might involve the characters needing to make\npeace with a rival gang, and having to convince both sides to sit\ndown and do it.\n\nGanger campaigns can often be humorous; gangers can be\nputzes. Without money or training, they aren't going to be good\nat much, and the kindest thing the gamemaster can do is to keep\nthe opposition at a manageable level. The point of the game is\nfun, so if the players come up with an in-character creative solu-\ntion, give it to them even if it’s not quite plausible. Gang cam-\npaigns can make a nice break from other campaigns or other\ngames. The weight of the world Is not on the characters’ shoulders\nin this type of campaign; they shouldn't feel much pressure to do\nthings right, and no matter how dumb, clumsy or inept they are,\nthey know that others are worse.\n\nIf you want to showcase the dark side of the streets of the\nfuture and the bleak life of the poor, a gang campaign is perfect\nfor that, too. Gang characters have nothing; they have to watch\ntheir friencis and family suffer without much power to help them.\nMost NPCs treat them like dirt, and when they try to earn some\nmoney shadowrunning, people take it as confirmation that they\nare nothing but worthless killers.\n\nCAMPAIGNING WITH GANGS\n\nThe following section complements the Archetypal\nAdventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by flesh-\ning out some of the concepts presented in that section.\n\nThe Premise\n\nThe characters are all part of an urban gang or tribe trying to\nsurvive and prosper in the Barrens or similar abandoned areas of\nthe metroplex. They must deal with all the challenges of the mean\nstreets, but have few resources to call upon. Any major metroplex\ncan serve as the setting for a gang campaign, with different set-\ntings offering different atmospheres and story opportunities.\nChoose.a setting with which the gamemaster and the players are\ncomfortabie; most of the campaign's stories will take place there\nand so the gamemaster needs to generate a large amount of\ndetailed information about the setting.The characters’ turf should\nbe especially well-defined. Many of the campaign's stories will\nhave a personal tone because they deal with small-scale events.\n\nThe Goal\n\nThe gang is family and tribe, and so loyalty to one’s fellow\ngang members is the most important quality. Never show weak-\nness in front of another gang. Answer all challenges to your\ngang's turf and honor. Never cooperate with “the man” or anyone\nelse in authority from outside your gang. Oh, and survive until\ntomorrow. Simple. eh?\n\nOpposition\n\nMajor antagonists for a gang campaign are other gangs who\nwant to cut into the characters’ turf and squeeze them out.\nConflicts between various gangs in the campaign can also be influ-\nenced by corporate interests working behind the scenes for their\nown purposes.\n\nThe hardware and resources available to shadowrunners\nrarely fall into the hands of a bunch of scroffy gangers. Therefore,\nconflict between gangs and the fight for day-to-day survival in the\nurban jungle offer plenty of opportunities for violent conflict, as\nmuch to get money and gear as for any other reason. Gang vio-\nlence often erupts in large-scale combats between two gangs, but\ncan also show up in small-scale brawls and challenges between\nindividual gangers. Finding ways to solve problems without vio-\nlence can be posed as an interesting challenge to characters in this\n\ntype of campaign.\nComplications\n\nThe restrictions on power may prove frustrating to some\nplayers; also, constantly tending to the needs of the gang may\ntake over the campaign and leave no room for other types of sto-\nries.\n\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nThe rules below answer some major questions and offer\nstrategies for dealing with some of the problems that may arise\nwhen running a gang campign.\n\nEarning Money\n\nShadowrun is usually a do-the-job-get-paid world. In a gang\ncampaign, however, characters aren't working for Mr. Johnson, so\nthere usually isn't any pay for their efforts. Gangers do what they\ndo for pride, honor and the amount of pain they can inflict on\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

        "text": "those they hate. That said, gang members must still earn cash to\nlive and improve their lot in life. Therefore, gangs usually run a\nmoney-making operation of some sort—nothing big, but enough\nto keep them flush,\n\nMost gangs get their cash by acting as middlemen in small-\ntime criminal deals—say, BTL dealing or selling illegal weapons.\nA simple way to figure rates of pay for this work is to assume that\nthe gang pays 10 to 6O percent of an illegal item's price and then\nsells it for the prices listed in various Shadowrun products. For\nexample, a gang selling BTL chips at approximately 50 nuyen\napiece might purchase them for 25 nuyen from their fixer; this\nnets the gang a 25-nuyen profit per chip. As always, the\ngamemaster can simulate the randomness of real-world econom-\nics by basing the percentage that the gangers pay on a D6 roll.\nThe gamemaster can also add or deduct an extra 5 or 10 percent,\ndepending on whether or not the gang won its last turf war or\ncompleted its most recent mission.\n\nGangs can also make money by stealing vehicles. Assuming\nthey don't steal the vehicle to use (which saves them money\nbecause they don’t have to buy one), they can sell it or strip it. If\nthey keep it, they can do anything they want with it—repaint it,\nsmash it into buildings, live out of it, whatever. If they decide to\nsell it, they can net up to 50 percent of the listed price. If the char-\nacters decide to strip the vehicle and sell the individual parts, they\nwill get the full price for the vehicle as listed, but cannot collect\nuntil a number of days equal to the total of the vehicle's Body and\nArmor ratings has passed.\n\nThe Sploches steal a Mitsubishi Nightsky out of\nparking lot near Dante's Inferno. They weigh their\noptions. The can keep the kick-butt car and use it\nagainst the Zero Hours, with whom the Sploches are\nat war. But the Sploches need nuyen. If they sell the\ncar whole, they can (maybe) get 125,000 nuyen—\nenough to keep the gang in arms, BTLs and synthe-\nhol for a long time. If they strip it, they can get the\nentire 250,000-nuyen purchase price, but the cred\nwould take 8 days to arrive (Body 5 + Armor 3 = 8).\nThe Sploches can't be sure the Zero Hours won't\nattack in those 8 days, so they decide to sell the car\n(after a couple of hits on a cash register or two on the\nway back to their home turf).\n\nReputation and Leadership\n\nEssentially, a gang's leader is the gang. The leader is the glue\nthat keeps the gang together, and the leader's rep is the gang’s\nrep. The leader of a gang relies on a combination of fear, reputa-\ntion and honor to retain his authority, rather than the standard\nLeadership skill. To determine a gang leader's (and therefore the\ngang's) Reputation Rating, use the standard Reputation rules (p.\n199, SRI), but use the character's total Karma Points. In addition\nto representing the target number for people outside his gang to\nknow of him or her, the Reputation Rating reflects how loyal the\nother gang members will be in a leadership battle (see below).\n\nLeadership Battle\n\nGangs get involved in infighting more often than gang wars.\nInvariably, a gang member will challenge the leader for control of\nthe gang in a one-on-one battle. Rules for a leadership battie are\ndetermined by the gamemaster and the player or players control-\nling the character or characters making the challenge. The fight\ncan be unarmed combat, a “one knife, two fighters” combat, an\nold-fashioned duel or any other known or imaginary version of\nsingle combat. The battle and the results can be humorous or a\nbloodbath. The fight can be to the death or to humiliation (which\nmany gangers consider far worse). The winner becomes (or\nremains) the gang leader.\n\nIn a leadership battle between the leaders of two gangs or\nthe leader of a gang and an outsider trying to take control of an\nestablished gang, one “contestant” may have a higher Leadership\nRating than the other. For each 2 additional points of Leadership\nRating of the higher-rated opponent, that opponent subtracts |\nfrom all tests made during the leadership battle. The winning\ngang gets the losing gang's assets and turf. At that point, each\nmember of the losing gang makes an Intelligence Test against the\nresult of the new leader's Reputation Rating minus his or her (the\nnew leader's) Charisma. (Subtracting the leader's Charisma repre-\nsents his or her efforts to sway the gang members into following\nhis or her leadership.) Those whose tests fail will walk away, either\nforming their own gang to exact revenge against the leader or\nbecoming that character's personal Enemies.\n\nRed, the leader of the Ladies from Hades,\ndecides to take on Goldy, the leader of the Medusas.\nRed wins. Red's Reputation is 15 and her Charisma is\n6, and so the nine surviving Medusas each make an\nIntelligence Test against a Target Number 9 (15-6 =\n9). Five of the Medusas make successful tests. The\nremaining four take off, to form a new gang or seek\nrevenge.\n\nGang Creation on the Fly\n\nWhen a group forms a gang, the opposition is usually anoth-\ner gang. To create an entire gang out of whole cloth, the\ngamemaster should use the Creating Prime Runners rules (p. 84).\nThe gamemaster should also make sure that the rival gang's num-\nbers match those of the player-character gang, or at least come\nclose. No matter how tough its members, a smaller gang will\nalways lose to a larger one in the long run, and so the gamemas-\nter should aim for a roughly equal balance of forces. Gangs have\none of four possible ratings: Inferior, Equal, Superior or\nSuperhuman. There are no Ultimate gangs. All gangs follow the\nstandard rules for ganger NPC statistics.\n\nIf an Inferior gang has double the numbers of the player char-\nacters’ gang, they are considered Equal for the purposes of Threat\nRatings and Dice Pools. An Inferior gang should have fewer lieu-\ntenants than the player characters’ gang.\n\nIf an Equal gang is twice as large as the player characters’\ngang, consider them Superior for purposes of Threat Ratings and\nDice Pools. If an Equal gang has less than half the numbers of the\nplayer characters’ gang, treat them as Inferior for determining\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

If such a gang has less than half the\nplayer-character gang's numbers, consider them Equal for deter-\nmining Threat Ratings and Dice Pools.

The\nSuperhuman gang has at least twice as many lieutenants as\nthe player characters’ gang.\n\nA Superhuman or Superior gang may have divisions in\nany of the less powerful classifications.

Renraku Security\neventually decided that enough was enough; they\nsent operatives to follow the Halloweeners and\ntheir then-leader, Funky Errak, to the gang's hide-\nout.

Slash has decided that all megacorps will pay\nfor Renraku’s crime, and has opened the ranks of the\nHalloweeners to anyone willing to take on the corps. This gang\nhas a reputation as one of the most psychotic in the sprawl.\nLeader: Slash and Burn, human. An incredibly skinny freak, he\nlikes to burn those who oppose his gang.\n\nLieutenants: 5\n\nZazz, a human mage and an original Halloweener who sur-\nvived along with Slash. Zazz still suffers nightmares about fire and\nhas a mental block against using any kind of fire spell.\n\nZany Janey, a human razorgirl and another original member.\nShe just loves to cut people—the more blood the better. Janey is\nSlash’s girl.\n\nHonest Jack, a dwarf. He rescued Zazz, Slash and janey from\nthe fire, which also destroyed his home. He became the first new\nmember of the Halloweeners, and he wants every corper dead.\nHe loves to shoot guns.\n\nSister Love, a female elf and a rigger. Sister is Zazz's main\nsqueeze.\n\nBobby Blue, a troll. He likes to hit people—any people.\nGang Rating: Superior\nHead Count: Approximately 25-40 members.\n\nInitation Rituals: The Halloweeners use two rituals. The first is the\nCircle of Fire, in which the gangers build a fire around the recruit.\nThe recruit remains in the middle of the fiery circle for about as\nlong as Slash remembers being in the burning building during the\nRenraku attack (approximately 5 to 10 minutes). The second ritu-\nal is to break into a megacorporate office and bring something\nback as proof.\n\nUniforms: The colors of the Halloweeners are orange and black,\nbefitting their name. Most often they wear black clothing, with\norange bandannas tied to their arms, legs or neck. They dress up\nto commit their crimes and almost always wear masks. Ever since\nthe fire, Slash prefers to wear a big ape head when having his fun.\nZazz favors a hellhound mask that looks freakishly real in the lights\nof the downtown arcologies.\n\nSymbol: Originally a pumpkin with an evil leer, the gang's symbol\nhas evolved to the now-familiar vague representation of a pump-\nkin (usually a circle with eyes and mouth) smiling demonically\nagainst a fiery background. The eyes and mouth seem to be com-\ning out of the fire.\n\nTerritory: The Halloweeners consider all of downtown and every\narcology their turf (that's where they fight their never-ending war,\nafter all). Their headquarters is just outside the downtown area, in\nthe docks south of the Renraku Arcology. They control and patrol\nthe docks up to and including the ones behind the Renraku\nArcology, plus the entire area west to the river (including half of\nKobe Terrace Park) up to the border of downtown.\n\nOperations: The Halloweeners make their nuyen in straight crime\nsprees. Most of what they sell goes to the Triads or the Seoulpa\nRings.\n\nFoes: The Halloweeners rarely fight other gangs. They prefer to\nconcentrate on their main enemies: Renraku security forces, Lone\nStar and (surprisingly enough) the yakuza and the Mafia. The\nHalloweeners will steal from anyone they think looks corporate\n\nenough, and the yaks and the Mob fit that bill. The Halloweeners\nsometimes run into trouble with other gangs because they tend to\nignore turf borders. Several gangs in the downtown area and\nsouth of downtown Seattle have fought with the Halloweeners at\nvarious times.\n\nUniqueness: Aside from Siash’s weird fire fetish, the\nHalloweeners have no specific modus operandi. They attack those\nthey perceive to be corporate wage slaves, make the occasional\nhit on the Renraku docks, and every once in a while pull a run on\nRenraku or some other downtown corp. Their crimes tend to be\nbrutal: multiple deaths, plenty of property damage, fires and so\non. The Halloweeeners like to set fires. From fear of their blood-\nthirsty reputation, no one hits them very hard or for very long.\nCertainly no one wants to be on Slash's hit list.\n\nTHE SPIDERS\n\nGang Focus: More than anything else, this multi-racial gang\nis characterized by its members’ implacable hatred of bug spirits.\nThis loathing is personal and visceral. Every one of the original\nSpiders fell into the hands of the Universal Brotherhood at some\npoint in his or her life, and none of them have gotten over the hor-\nrors they experienced. Living to destroy bugs, in the company of\na like-minded “family,” is their way of dealing with these traumas.\nTheir links with the Spider totem, which each gang member meets\nas part of his or her initiation ritual, reinforces this fiercely anti-bug\nmindset.\n\nThe gang is extremely violent, but keeps a relatively low pro-\nfile nonetheless. Unlike other violent gangs, they never leave\n“calling cards” or other clues to their presence. Like the spiders\nthey emulate, these gangers prefer to strike silently as well as\nlethally. They recruit new members by snatching likely prospects\noff the Seattle streets and brainwashing them into joining the\ngang over the course of several days. Their methods are brutal\nand effective; most prospective recruits become true believers in\nshort order.\n\nLeader: Widow, a human Spider shaman. She wears black all the\ntime, to set off her pale skin and gray eyes. She could be any-\nwhere from 20 to 35 years old—no one can tell for sure. She is\nincredibly vain about her hands, which are long and narrow and\nextremely graceful.\n\nLieutenants: 5\n\nTarantula, a young ork recently promoted after singlehanded-\nly killing two roach spirits with a jerry-built contraption that she\nrefers to as “my Raid can.” Barely out of her teens, Tarantula is\nWidow's protege; the gang leader treats her almost like a daugh-\nter. Tarantula repays this regard with fanatical loyalty, imitating\neverything Widow says or does.\n\nFiddler, an elf and founding member of the gang. Skinny and\nundernourished, with piercing black eyes, Fiddler is a city-dweller\ndown to his toenails; he claims he can't breathe if he goes too far\naway from the concrete jungle. His arms are covered with puck-\nered scars, about which he refuses to speak.\n\nTrapdoor, a dwarf. He hates wasp spirits above all other bugs,\nthough he'll glady kill any bugs he can get his hands on. Trapdoor\nplays incessantly with a cat's cradle, and can make more shapes\nwith it than anyone alive ever knew existed.\n\nSHADOWRUN Companion"

The Spiders picked him up in the\nRedmond Barrens within weeks of his arrival in Seattie,\nsized him up as a potentially powerful magician, and\nmade him their own in record time.

She\nrarely talks to anyone except Fiddler, and even to\nhim rarely uses more than two or three words at\na time. She's deadly with almost any kind of\nblade, but is especially partial to a jagged-edged\nhunting knife that she’s named “Sweeney.”\nSomewhere, Recluse picked up detailed knowl-\nedge of anatomy (though she doesn’t remember\nwhere anymore), and so she supervises the bulk of\nthe gang's organiegging activity.\n\nGang Rating: Superior\n\nHead Count: Approximately 50-100 members\nInitiation Rituals: Each prospective recruit goes on a\nvision quest to meet Spider and receive his or her\ngang name (always the name of a spider). Those who\nsurvive this ordeal become gang members; those\nwho don't generally die raving with a day or two of\nthe quest’s end. Once a new ganger receives a\nname, he or she is assigned a specific task as part\nof “guarding the Web.” In practice, this usually\nmeans a specific building to protect, area to patrol,\nor other job to do that somehow relates to keeping\nthe gang's territory bug-free. More experienced\ngangers explain carefully to each newbie exactly what\ntheir assigned task is, how best to do it, and why it's\nimportant in the Scheme of Things.\n\nAfter proving themselves by fulfilling their\nassigned tasks well, new gangers move on to Part 2 of\ntheir initiation—kidnapping a potential initiate. They usual-\nly also take part in the brainwashing of their victim, some-\ntimes even assuming the leading role. Once they accomplish\nthis, they are eligible to become lieutenants.\n\nTo become a lieutenant, a ganger must kill a bug spirit sin\nglehandedily. The ganger in question seeks out a nest of bugs\nand informs at least five fellow gangers of his or her intent to\nkill one. These witnesses accompany the gang member to\nground zero, where they watch the ganger attempt to kill\nthe bug. They do not intervene unless their fellow ganger\nlooks likely to lose the fight, in which case they will jump into\ncombat to save the ganger's life. The ganger does not become a\nlieutenant, however, and must spend at least a year living down\nthe disgrace before being permitted to try again.\nUniforms: The Spiders wear synthleather jackets in the gang’s\ncolors: black or dark brown and red.

These symbols\nmay be painted or embroidered on jackets, worn as shoulder\npatches or jewelry, tattooed on the ganger’s body, or anything\nelse the ganger desires. All gang members wear web tattoos on\ntheir shaved scalps.\n\nTerritory: The Spiders claim all of Redmond as their territory,\nwhich they refer to as “the Web.” According to rumor, their head-\nquarters is an abandoned warehouse in a particularly godforsaken\nsection of Redmond known as Brain Heaven.\n\nOperations: To finance their bug-\nhunting expeditions and pay for\ntheir living expenses, the Spiders\nmost often serve as couriers,\nfences and other types of criminal\nmiddlemen. They also frequently\nresort to petty theft. The\n\nmost lucrative of their\nactivities is\norgan-legging,\nas they have a\nsteady supply of\nfailed recruits\nto carve up\nfor spare\nparts.\n\nFoes: The\ngang consid-\ners bug spirits\nof all types\nas its pri-\nmary foes,\nand will\ngo out of\nits way to\nassault\nbugs or\nany-\n\n~\n\nAIGN Concepts\n\nthe gang perceives as being somehow “in league” with the bugs.\n(This definition can be fairly loose, depending on who's making\nthe call.) The Spiders also have occasional run-ins with other\ngangs in Redmond, generally when another gang “refuses to\naccept the Spiders’ protection from the evil bug spirits.”\nUniqueness: The Spiders pride themselves on acting like their\nnamesakes—moving silently and striking so swiftly that the\n“enemy” is immobilized or dead before he knows what hit him.\nThey mark their territory with signs rather than patrols; an intrud-\ner into Spider turf will suddenly find himself surrounded by\ngangers who seemingly materialized from thin air, and will short-\nly afterward be unconscious or a corpse. This “guerrilla warfare”\napproach has made the Spiders a force to be reckoned with,\nagainst bug spirits and in more ordinary criminal\nactivities. Spider couriers have a reputation for being\nable to deliver the goods in record time;\nSpider fences are known for webs of\ncontacts so dazzlingly vast that most\nattempts to trace the sale of illegal\ngoods back to the gang end in failure.\n\nTHE SPIKES\nGang Focus: Once a run-of-the-mill\ngo-gang. the Spikes (formerly the\nSpike Wheels) have recently\ncome under the leadership of a\ncharismatic troll named Lord Torgo.\nTorgo became the gang boss after sin-\nglehandedly destroying one of its\nmajor rivals, the Silent Ps; after\nthe victory, he changed the\ngang's name to reflect its\nimproved status.

Though as poorly\neducated as any\nother lifelong resident\nof Seattle's\nslums, he\nis fantastically\nintelligent, and\nreads everything\nhe can get his mitts\non.

Current rumor among the Spikes says he\nactually lost it in a poker game with the gang’s previous leader,\nand that Torgo won it back for him.

He can accomplish this any way he wishes, but must\nhave at least two witnesses to the killing and must bring back a\n“trophy” for Lord Torgo to put on display. Favorite trophies are\nears and scalps—the latter especially if the victim had hair of an\nunusual color,\n\nUniforms: All gang members wear camo fatigues, in keeping with\nLord Torgo’s conceit that the gang is actually a disciplined private\narmy. Gang members also wear gold bandannas, most often tied\naround their heads or upper arms.\n\nSymbol: Usually spray-painted on the sides of vehicles they've\ntrashed, the Spikes’ symbol is a crudely drawn elf head with Xes\nfor eyes; the head is pierced by a spike, which frequently (though\nnot always) has blood dripping from It.\n\nTerritory: The Spikes claim Interstate 5 and the neighborhoods\nsurrounding it, from just south of downtown Seattle all the way to\nthe Tir Tairngire border—this area includes Fort Lewis, Puyallup\nand Hell's Kitchen. Their HQ is rumored to be in Fort Lewis,\nthough no one knows exactly where.\n\nOperations: As the “tollkeepers” of Interstate 5, the Spikes are\nperfectly placed to indulge in their favorite activity—attacking\nanything and anyone going into or coming out of Tir Tairngire.\nAny vehicle on the road is fair game, but favorite targets include\nshipments of goods with potentially high value in Seattle's shad-\nows. In addition to (literal) highway robbery, the Spikes are known\nfor particularly vicious hate crimes against elves.\n\nFoes: Lord Torgo’s personal ambition is to destroy the Ancients,\nSeattle's best-known elf gang. He and his fellow gangers love to\nuse Tir border patrols as target practice. As the gang's primary\nenemies are elves, they rarely bother ork or human or dwarf\ngangs unless provoked.\n\nUniqueness: One of the few all-troll gangs in the Seattle sprawl,\nthe Spikes are known for their unorthodox mode of attacking\ntheir chosen targets. Like the ancient Mongol hordes who gal-\nloped across the steppes of Central Asia, the Spikes ride down\n\ntheir victims en masse; the sight of a posse of troll bikers thun-\ndering toward a truck or armored car, howling all the way, has\ngiven more than one driver heart failure.\n\nTHE RED HOT NUKES\n\nGang Focus: The Red Hot Nukes prefer to think of themselves\nas a neighborhood association rather than a gang, despite their\nclearly illegal activities. They regard their primary mission as pro-\ntecting and aiding residents of their neighborhood any way they\ncan. Though membership is only open to dwarfs, the Nukes dis-\nplay no prejudice against other races; they will defend their peo-\nple against any threat, and define “their people” as being every-\none who lives on their turf.\nLeader: Grinder, a young black dwarf and ex-runner with an anar-\nchist bent. Grinder is a physical adept, and is personally training\nevery member of the Nukes to be as talented a physad as he is.\nOn the rare occasions when Grinder gets tipsy, he hints at his\ndeep dark reason for founding and training the gang—he claims\nto have discovered some horrible future event while on an anti-\nmegacorp run a few years ago, which he is grooming the Nukes\nto prevent. He refuses to tell anyone exactly what this future is;\nthe mere mention of it gives him nightmares.\nLieutenants: None.\nGang Rating: Equal\nHead Count: Approximately 15-25 members.\nInitiation Rituals: Each new recruit must prove himself by dis-\narming a bomb built by Grinder. Those who fail this test are blown\nto smithereens.\nUniforms: The Red Hot Nukes wear gray and red, and each of\nthem sports a baseball-style cap.\nSymbol: The gang's insignia is a mushroom cloud, which com-\nmemorates both their name and their skill with explosives. The\nsymbol appears somewhere on every ganger's clothing, often\npainted on their jackets or worn as a patch on the jacket or cap.\nTerritory: The Nukes claim Redmond as their turf; their heacquar-\nters is in the Hollywood neighborhood.\nOperations: The Nukes specialize in jobs that require expertise\nwith explosives. In addition to demolitions, they build small\nbombs for use in protection rackets and insurance scams; local\nbusinessmen who need ready cash frequently call on the Nukes to\ndestroy their businesses so that they can then pocket the insur-\nance money. Part of every ganger's training involves bomb-build-\ning with a wide variety of materials; the Nukes go out of their way\nto avoid “signature” bomb-making styles so that law enforcement\ncan't trace explosive devices back to them. The gang also pulls the\noccasional theft, or even wetwork if the price Is right.\nFoes: Perhaps reflecting their leader's ex-runner background, the\nNukes are anti-corporate to the point of paranoia. Though they do\nmost of their demolition work for pay, they carry out a certain\nnumber of sabotage runs against corporate research installations,\nthe more obscure the better. They regard most of the other gangs\nin Redmond as “enemies of the people,” and fight them when\nthey must; however, they don’t go looking for trouble. The Spiders\nand the Rusty Stilettos are the most frequent targets of punitive\naction by the Nukes, as they are more likely than other gangs to\nchallenge the Nukes’ authority.\n\nSHADOWRUN ComPepantion"

Unlike their twentieth-century counter-\nparts, the Night Hunters don't discriminate based on skin color or\ngender: only metahumans are the targets of their hatred. They\nlean toward the Humanis policlub party line, and proudly act as\nfront-line thugs in the policlub’s war “to make the world safe for\ntrue humanity.” They are often violent, but actually kill their vic-\ntims far less often than most people believe.

Stiv grew up in a respectable middle-class home,\nruled by his father’s iron hand. Father was a preacher of the fire-\nand-brimstone variety, and as the oldest child Stiv got the llon’s\nshare of harsh paternal attention. He is a classic sociopath—high-\nly Intelligent and completely lacking in empathy or conscience.\nWhen under extreme stress, he burns himself with cigarettes as a\nway of proving himself impervious to pain.\n\nLieutenants: 2 (main group; splinter gangs vary)\n\nSplitter, a stocky half-Amerind woman with vicious knife scars\non her cheek and throat. She claims to have gotten the scars on\nthe Night of Rage, when a rampaging band of trolls broke into her\nhome and murdered the rest of her family. The trolls left her for\ndead, but she managed to drag herself to the household PAN-\nICBUTTON and call DocWagon. Orphaned and homeless, she sur-\nvived as best she could on the streets of Seattle until the Night\nHunters took her in when she was ten years old. She has never\ntried to challenge Stiv's authority; she considers it a waste of time\nas long as there are metahumans around to hurt.\n\nShank, a skinny mulatto of nineteen who has been Stiv’s\nright-hand man for the past five years. Shank hails most recently\nfrom Redding in Northern CalFree. and has an especial loathing of\nelves (though other metas aren’t much better, to his way of think-\ning). Abandoned by his mother at a young age, Shank doesn't\nknow who his father is; lately, though, he’s been fantasizing that\nDaddy is really Kenneth Brackhaven, Shank would never presume\non the relationship, however; he merely wants to admire his\n“father” from afar. Right now, the Night Hunters are all the family\nhe needs.\n\nGang Rating: Equal\n\nHead Count: Approximately 20-30 members.\n\nInitiation Rituals: Each new recruit must brand a metahuman with\nthe Night Hunters’ symbol. Some Hunter gangs will accept paint-\ning the symbol on a metahuman’s skin, but most gangs prefer\n\nmore painful methods. The favorites are burning (like cattie brand-\ning) and carving the symbol about a quarter-inch into the skin with\na rusty knife. Particularly sadistic gangers follow up the second\nmethod by sprinkling salt into the cuts.\n\nUniforms: Night Hunters favor head-to-toe black leather orna-\nmented with chains and studs. All of them, male and female, wear\ntheir hair in mohawks dyed bright green. Every Night Hunter\nsports three hand razors on one hand, which they use to make\ntheir distinctive slashing mark.\n\nSymbol: A talon siashing the moon. They wear the symbol most\noften on clothing or as a scalp tattoo. Many of the gang members\nlike to draw the symbol on their jackets in glow-in-the-dark paint;\nthat way, their intended victims can see them coming and feel the\nappropriate terror.\n\nTerritory: The Hunters claim all of Renton, but lack enough mem-\nbers to patrol the area. Countless splinter gangs exist, all but one\nof whom continue to call themselves the Night Hunters; the sin-\ngle exception is the group known as the Werewolves, which split\nfrom the main band of Hunters three or four years ago and has\nmanaged to share the gang's turf relatively peacefully.\nOperations: The Night Hunters trade in BTLs for money; aside\nfrom that, they commit whatever crime seems like it might be the\nmost fun way to kill a slow afternoon. They are partial to vandal-\nism—there’s nothing most Night Hunters like better than making\nlots of noise and smashing things, especially if they can terrorize\nsome metahumans in the process. They rarely kill their metahu-\nman victims; for most Hunters, the thrill is in humiliation and tor-\nture. A corpse doesn’t cringe or beg for mercy, and so is no fun\nany more.\n\nFoes: The primary foe of all Night Hunter gangs is the entire\nmetahuman population of Seattle. From the high-level elf corpo-\nrator to the ork janitor down the street, all metas are equally fair\ngame (though they prefer the very old and the very young as the\neasiest to intimidate).\n\nOther Night Hunter groups, formed when one lieutenant or\nanother tried and failed to unseat Stiv, are hostile to the main\ngang (and to each other). Each splinter group sees itself as the\n“true” Night Hunters to a greater or lesser degree; the various\ngroups act out this belief by assaulting each other or else refusing\nto acknowledge each other's existence. On occasion, one Night\nHunter gang declares a holy war against another; these wars\ninvariably fizzle out after the first couple of casualties, however.\nUniqueness: More than any other human-only gang, the Night\nHunters are obssessed with humillating metahumans. If a\nganger's day goes by without his at least being able to spit on an\nelf or trip up a troll, that day has been an utter waste of time.\nNight Hunters love to collect trophies from their metahuman vic-\ntims, especially elf ears, troll and ork tusks, and dwarf beards\n(complete with the layer of skin that used to cover the unlucky\ndwarf's chin), The gangs’ distinctive triple arrangement of hand\nrazors is highly unusual.\n\nSHADOWRUN COmMmPAaAnION\n\n10"
